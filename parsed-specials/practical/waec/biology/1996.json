A food substance was put in two test tubes labeilcd I and Il in test tube , Fehling's solutions A and B were added and the mixture warmed. A negative result was obtained. In test tube Il dilute hydrochloric acid was added and the mixture was boiled, after which few drops of sodium hyddroxide were added. Then Fehling's solutions A and B were added. A positive result was obtained in test tube H after warming (a) What colour should indicate a positive result in test tube lI? (b) What food substance must have given the positive result in test tube l1? (c) What role did dilute hydrochloric acid play in the test? (d) Why was sodium hydroxide added to test tube l1?
