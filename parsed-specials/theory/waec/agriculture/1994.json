The food gets to the rumen through the oesophagus by peristalsis. Micro-organisms in the rumen act on the grass. The cattle rests quietly an regurgitates the food back to the mouth through the reticulum by anti-peristaltic movement where the food is properly re-chewed in the mouth. After chewing,t cud is re-swallowed and the food goes to the omasum and later to the abomasum where enzymes are secret on the food. The digested food is absorbed into t body through the villi while the undigested ones a passed into the large intestine from where they are r moved as feaces or dung through the anus. </p>",
