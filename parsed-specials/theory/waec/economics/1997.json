At the point of equilibrium, the quantity produced is OQ while the price is OP. At that point he is able to cover both the AC and MC. The super -normal profit can now be determined thus: Total Revenue = OPOQ<br>\nTotal Cost = OCOQ<br>\nProfit = TR - TC = OPOQ - OCOQ<br>\nQuantity =PCSE or the shaded portion <br>\n </p>",
