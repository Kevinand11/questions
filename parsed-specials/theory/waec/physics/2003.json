        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) Liquids consist of molecules in random motion having different velocities, hence near the surface molecules with higher velocities and kinetic energy escape from the surface. Therefore the average kinetic energy of the remaining liquid is reduced. Since the average kinetic energy is a measure of temperature, therefore temperature is lowered. Hence evaporation causes cooling.</p><p>(ii) The heat supplied to boiling water increases the kinetic energy of the molecules and also weaken the bonds between the molecules. Hence at boiling the heat supplied is used in breaking the bonds, therefore molecules escaped as steam without change in temperature.</p><p>(b) (i) Boyle's law states that the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature varies inversely as the pressure upon it.</p><p>(ii)</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/67958167_910010476015748_7977110877042114560_n.jpg\" style=\"height:168px; width:208px\"></p><p>Introduce dry air into burette (B) and close the tap.
