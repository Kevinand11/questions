        "answer": "<p>(a) How the human ear carries out its function of balancing; </p><p>- Head movement in any direction affect the fluid/endolymph, In the semi-circular canals, Which are at right angles to each other, The movement forces the sensory/hair cells in the ampulla to set up the impulses, The brain interprets the impulses and relays the impulses to the body muscles for balancing.</p><p>(b)(i) Diagram of the Human Ear;</p><p><img alt=\"Open Photo\" src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/p206x206/237608260_433315604586745_7009314379469924529_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=aee45a&amp;_nc_eui2=AeEAAXrmLKLsqXA_gWI686d14KiKuy5i_nvgqIq7LmL-e3Prktlt4Q9VpHBSr_gHRrkYrrH7JoUFDEkJeufsoVEH&amp;_nc_ohc=SEUM93RuYWkAX8c74Ou&amp;_nc_ad=z-m&amp;_nc_cid=0&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.xx&amp;oh=1580df27466ce2582788fb7772c6c16c&amp;oe=6144334D\"></p><p>(b)(ii) Description of the structure of the middle ear; The middle ear is an air filled chamber, It connects the ear drum of the oval window fenestra ovalis. It contains three bones/hammer/malleus, anvil/incus and stapes/stirrup/ear ossicles. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane/tympanum/eardrum. Each of the bones has direct contact with the one next to it, the eustachian tube is formed at the base of the middle ear . The eustachian tube links the ear to the throat/pharynx.</p>",
