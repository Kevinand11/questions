The stomach also has hydrochloric acid to form acid medium which kills bacteria. It helps in storing or temporal storage of undigested food.</p><p>(3) It produces churning movement which aids mixing of food with digestive juice.</p><p><strong>(c) Test for protein can be carried out through million's test or biuret test.<br>\nMillion test: </strong>Prepare an aqueous suspension of food sample, add a few drops of million's reagent. White precipitate is formed. Then, heat the mixture. Red or pin red precipitate is formed, which shows the presence of protein.</p><p><strong>Biuret Test:- </strong>Make an aqueous suspension of food sample, add 2cm3 of 2% of sodium hydroxide solution, mix or shake it. Add a few drops of 1% dilute copper sulphate solution. Violet or purple colour will be formed which shows the presence of protein. </p>",
