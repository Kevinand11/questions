        "answer": "<p>(a) (i) The law of independent assortment states that each member of alleles or contracting character may combine randomly with either member of another pair.</p><p><strong>(ii) Findings of Mendel's experiment involving white and red flowered pea plants:- </strong>On crossing white and red flowered pea plants, he obtained all red - flowered offspring, but on self-.crossing each of these red- flowered plants he obtained mixtures of red flowered and white flowered plants in the ratio of 3:1 (¾ red / ¼ white flowered).</p><p>(iii) <strong>Illustrations</strong>: Key for parental genotype e.g R for red, r for white <br>\n </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/1999%203.jpg\" style=\"height:94px; width:350px\"></p><p>(b) Blood grouping in man is determined by three alternative genes (alleles) A, B, and 0. A person can only possess two (alleles) of the genes on a pair of homologous chromosomes. 0 is recessive to both A and B, hence it is possible to have blood group A and AA (homozygous) and AO (heterozygous) and group B as BB or BO. However, group 0 can only exist genotypically as 00 in the homozygous recessive state. <br>\n </p>",
