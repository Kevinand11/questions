        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) Co-dominance:</strong> Co-dominance occurs when both the alleles in an heterozygous individual are fully expressed; that is both alleles exert their effects so that the hybrid has a phenotype; that is different from what the parents exhibit.</p><p><strong>(ii) Calculation of individuals with co-dominant blood group: </strong>Mention of co-dominant blood group is AB.
