        "answer": "<p>(a) Resonance occurs whenever a particular body or system is set in oscillation at its own natural frequency as a result of impulses received from some other body or system which is vibrating with the same frequency.

The length, L between the bridges is adjusted until the wire resonates with the vibrating tuning fork. This happens when a paper rider flies off or when a loud sound is heard. Then, measure length, L of the resonating wire and frequency f. The experiment is repeated for at least four other tuning forks of known frequencies. In each case the values of the frequency, f and the corresponding length, L are recorded. A graph of f is plotted against 1/L or L against 1/f. A straight-line graph passing through origin is obtained showing that frequency is proportional to the reciprocal of the length.</p><p>(iii) Precautions:</p><p>(1) A smooth pulley should be used</p><p>(2) the tuning fork should be struck on a rubber bung</p><p>(c) For a fundamental note</p><p>f\\(_o\\) = \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\)  = \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{m}}\\)</p><p>where f\\(_o\\) = fundamental frequency</p><p>L = Length of string</p><p>T = Tension m = linear density or mass per unit length of the string</p><p>(i) \\(f_1 = \\frac{1}{20} \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{m}}\\) = 3(\\(\\frac{1}{20} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{20}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m}})\\)</p><p>f\\(_1 = 3f_o\\)</p><p>i.e = the fundamental frequency, \\(f_o\\) is tripled</p><p>(ii) \\(f_2 = \\frac{1}{20} (\\frac{1}{20} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{m}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{20} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m}} = f_2 = \\frac{1}{2} f_o\\)</p><p>i.e the fundamental frequency, \\(f_o\\) is halved</p>",
