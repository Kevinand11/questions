When the platinum contacts touch ar,d the key k is closed, current passes through the primary coil and the core is magnetised.  The soft iron armature is then attracted so the, the platinum contacts separate and the circuit is broken. When this happens, the core loses its magnetism and the armature is pulled back by the spring so that contact is re-established. As the contact is repeatedly made and broken in the primary circuit, changes of magnetic flux take place and induces an e.m.f. in the secondary coil. Because of the much larger number of turns in the secondary compared with the primary, a very high e.m.f is induced in the secondary coil which is sufficient to cause a spark to jump across the spark gap.</p><p>(c) The core of the coil is made of bundle of soft-iron wires OR that are of the coil is laminated.

        "answer": "<p>(a) Surface tension is the property of a liquid which makes its surface behave as though covered with an elastic sink. Or it is the tangential force on the surface of a liquid.

The molecule A will be attracted uniformly in all directions trot pulled in any one particular. direction. On the other hand, B is attracted more by molecules within the body of the liquid and it therefore experiences a resultant inward force at right angles to the surface. There will therefore be a tendency for the surface of the liquid to contact and have as little an area as possible. The surface is thus in a tension.<br>\nDiagram or description link</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/67754051_408932573299134_3682861918617337856_n%2812%29.jpg\" style=\"height:81px; width:196px\"></p><p> </p><p>NB: Water and needle shown but not labelled </p><p>A beaker is filled to the brim with water as shown above. A dry needle is placed on a small piece of filter paper, which is then gently placed on the water surface.

        "answer": "<p>a) The boiling pointer of a liquid is the temperature at which its s.v.p. is equal to the external atmospheric pressure OR The temperature at which a (pure) liquid boils when the atmospheric pressure on it is 760 mm Hg.
