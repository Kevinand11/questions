Pressure belts are created by temperature. When the temperature of a place is very high, it creates a high pressure belt. Wind which carries a lot of moisture therefore blows from a region of high pressure belt to regions of low pressure belts. This therefore results in heavy rainfall in areas of low pressure belts and light rainfall in areas of high pressure belts. <br>\n </p>",
