        "answer": "<p>(a) The difference between rotation and revolution of the earth. Rotation is the type of earth's movement in which it moves on its axis from west to east once in 24hrs making one day. Revolution is the second type of movement of the earth in which it revolves around th sun in 3651/4 days making a year.</p><p><strong>(b) Two effects of rotation are the; </strong></p><p>(i) day and night</p><p>(ii) the deflection c winds and ocean currents</p><p>(c) The eclipse of the sun is formed when the moon comes between the sun and the earth. When there is an eclipse of the moon, shadow of tne moon is cast, on the earth which could result in either partial or full darkness on the earth. The moon prevents the sun rays from getting to the earth. The positions of the sun, moon and the earth in an eclipse of the sun are shown in the diagram below </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/91%2022%281%29.jpg\" style=\"height:107px; width:300px\"><br>\n </p>",
