        "answer": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%2022.jpg\" style=\"height:134px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Delta is a feature of lower course of rivers with many distributaries: It is actuate, bird foot or fan-shaped and low lying at the mouth of rivers. Examples are Niger delta, I Main Stream Nile, Mississippi.<br>\n<strong>Formation</strong>: Presence of tideless coast or (River Niger) sheltered coast, sluggish river with heavy deposition of silt at the mouth and availability of lowland areas towards the mouth Tributaries of a river.<br>\n<strong>Uses</strong>: Good agricultural land especially for cultivation' of rice, oil palms and raffia palms. It is also good for fishing and petroleum mining </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%2033.jpg\" style=\"height:123px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Two parallel consequent rivers with tributaries separated by a river more powerful and with presence of wind gap. Examples are River irrawady in India, River Ogunpa (Ibadan), in Nigeria.<br>\n<strong>Formation</strong>: One river erodes more aggressively than the other; the more powerful river makes greater rate of headward erosion. The more powerful river cuts through river divide then captures water of weaker stream. The lower part of the pirated stream now forms what is called misfit, the point of capture is termed elbow of capture and a wind gap is formed.<br>\n<strong>Uses</strong>: Rich in agricultural land with the vegetation always available for cattle. The wind gap serves as communication route. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%20333.jpg\" style=\"height:103px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Feature of upper course of river,with steep slope which forms plunge pool. Examples are Kwa fall, Victoria fall, Niagara fall, Erin-ljesa fall, etc<br>\n<strong>Formation:</strong> Resistant rock forms a bar across a river valley, fault line scarp lies across a river course, water plunges down the plateau edge, this may develop to form rapids. Undercutting softer rocks and water fall recedes upstream.</p><p><strong>(iv) Inselberg - Appearance:</strong> Is found in semi and / arid land form in isolated rocky out crops/composed of granite or gneiss, steep sided/may occur singly or in group round/flat topped-dome shaped. Polished surface/may rise up to over 500 metres with screes found at the base. Examples are Tibesti Plateau, ldanre Hill, Senna hill, Olumo hill, Ahaggar plateau, all in Northern Nigeria and Kalahari desert. Western Australia.<br>\n<strong>Formation:</strong> Formed in semi arid regions, mechanical weathering is dominant and extensive in old plateau(s). Weathering and removal of weathered materials by water and wind with the hard outcrops now exposed.<br>\n<strong>Uses: </strong>Tourism and quarrying <br>\n </p>",

Presence of bluffs, river cliffs, meanders, terraces and some deposition take place</p><p><strong>(iii) Lower Course: </strong>Lateral corrosion continues with deposition, meander, braiding and levee. Presence of flood plains, increase in volume of water, Ox-bow lakes, deferred confluence, delta and terraces.</p><p><strong>(b) Importance of rivers to man: </strong></p><p>(i) Transportation of goods and people</p><p>(ii) Generation of H.

Rising air becomes saturated and water vapour condenses with cloud formed quickly and heavy rains accompanied by thunder and lightening.</p><p><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Short lived, heavy winds, lightening and thunder. Rain galls within limited areas usually in the afternoons. Clear skies immediately after the rain and hailstone may occur. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%2044.jpg\" style=\"height:133px; width:300px\"></p><p><strong>Formation</strong>: Moist air is forced to rise above a mountain/relief barrier usually on the windward slopes of mountains. Rising air expands and becomes cooler and relative humidity rises and air becomes saturated. Water vapour condenses, cloud is formed with rainfall on the windward slope and descending air on the leeward side<br>\n<strong>Characteristics</strong>: Associated with mountainous regions with even distribution of rainfall over a highland. Windward area has rainfall while leeward side has little or no rainfall and associated with ascending and descending wind.</p><p><strong>(iii) Cyclonic Rainfall-Formation: </strong>Caused by the meeting of two air masses, the two air masses are different in terms of origin and characteristics. Warm, light, moisture Iadden air rises above cold and dense air. Ascent of the warm air over cold air lowers the temperature of the warm air, cooling takes places and condensation occurs, cloud formation and precipitation follow: <br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%20444.jpg\" style=\"height:106px; width:300px\"><br>\n<strong>Characteristics</strong>: Associated with fronts and weather system in mild latitudes.
