        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) River Capture: </strong>This is also called river piracy or river beheading. It results when a river through head water of erosion into a water divide cuts up the headwater of another but a weaker river. The river pirated is called misfit and the point of capture is called elbow of capture The valley below the elbow is called wind gap. <br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/94%2022.jpg\" style=\"height:145px; width:300px\"></p><p><strong>(i) Waterfall: </strong>This is formed as a result of unequal resistance of hard and soft rocks transverse by a river. The out crop of a band of hard rock may cause a river to fall downstream in greater dimension from some heights called waterfall </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/94%20222.jpg\" style=\"height:161px; width:300px\"></p><p>(b) One way in which river capture is useful to man is channelization of water away from settlements while waterfall is useful for the generation of hydro-electric power</p>",
