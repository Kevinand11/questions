Before wind abrasion can produce Zengen, fissures or cracks opened by very high temperature on the desert surface must have occurred on the hard surface layer. Wind abrasion then attacks the desert surface through the fissures already existing. The fissures are widened to become furrows while the blocks between the fissures (now furrows) become ridges called \"Zengens\" </p>",
