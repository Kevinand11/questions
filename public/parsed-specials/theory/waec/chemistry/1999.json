        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) Postulates of the kinetic theory of gases: Gas molecules move randomly in straight lines. They collide with one another and with the walls of the container. The temperature of the gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecule. The forces of attraction between gas molecules are negligible. The volume occupied by gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container. The collision of the molecules is perfectly elastic (any three).</p><p>(ii) Sketches to illustrate Boyle's Law</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/i.jpeg\" style=\"height:93px; width:486px\"></p><p> </p><p>(iii) Absolute zero of temperature is the temperature at which the volume of a gas would be (theoretically) reduced to zero.
