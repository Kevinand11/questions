        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) What is a gene?</strong> Genes are units of heredity located in the chromosomes which are responsible for the coding of a particular protein to transfer trait or character from parents to offspring.</p><p><strong>(ii) Differentiate between the terms genotype and phenotype:</strong> Genotype is the genetic make-up of genes in an organism that is independent of the environment while a phenotype is all observable features, appearance of the organism that is determined by the environment and the genotype.</p><p><em><strong>(b) Explain the following terms: </strong></em><br>\n(i) <strong>Hybrid</strong>: Offspring produced from a cross between two parents with contrasting characters.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Pure-breeding:</strong> A process of producing a particular genotype over many generations.</p><p>(iii) <strong>Nucleotides</strong>: The basic building block of a nucleic acid consisting of a ribose, deoxyribose. protein, a phosphate group and a nitrogen base.</p><p>(c) In a garden, pea seeds, smooth seed coat is dominant over rough feed coat. With the aid of a genetic diagram, determine the result expected if a homozygous rough pea is crossed with a smooth seed coat plant whose parents were rough coated. <br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/2012.jpg\" style=\"height:217px; width:400px\"></p>",
