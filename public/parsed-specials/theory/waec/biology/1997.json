The style serves as the passage way for germinating pollen grain to reach the ovule. The Ovule develops to seed after fertilization and Placenta connects ovule or seed to the ovary for nourishment.</p><p>(b)(ii) The ovary produces ovum/egg/hormones. The Funnel receives the ovum or egg. Fallopian tube or oviduct serves as a passage way for ovum or site of fertilization. The Uterus or womb houses the embryo till birth. The Vagina is the passage way for the baby during birth and it receives male organs (penis) and sperm during coition or intercourse. The Vulva is the entrance to the vagina. It receives male organ or penis and serves as a passage way for baby. </p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td><strong>Mammals</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Amphibians</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Birds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>No of eggs<br>\nFertilization  <br>\nParental care</p>\n</td>\n<td>One or few<br>\nInternal<br>\nPresent and fora Iona time</td>\n<td>Many<br>\nExternal<br>\nAbsent </td>\n<td>\n<p>Many or few<br>\nInternal<br>\nPresent but for a short time </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><p><br>\n </p>",
