        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) A receptor;</strong> is a sensory cell which receives stimuli, initiates and transmits an impulse through neurons to the brain, spinal cord or the central nervous system.</p><p><strong>(b) General features common to all receptors: </strong>Generally, receptors consist of a group of sensory cells with their free surfaces bearing, short hair-like processes otherwise called dendrites. Around their basal portions are nerve fibres which lead to the spinal or cranial nerves and the central nervous system.</p><p>(c) Diagram showing the outer/external and middle ear of human. <br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/2002%202.jpg\" style=\"height:208px; width:300px\"></p><p><strong>(ii) How to care for the ear: </strong><br>\n(i) avoid inserting sharp objects into the ear<br>\n(ii) clean regularly with cotton buds<br>\n(iii) report any ear discharge or problem to the medical doctor<br>\n(iv) avoid places of loud noise<br>\n(v) avoid misuse of ear-phones<br>\n(vi) avoid introducing hot liquid into the ear<br>\n(vii) treat measles and meningitis instantly to prevent deafness<br>\n(viii) avoid using quinine carelessly <br>\n </p><p> </p>",
