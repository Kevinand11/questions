In each case, state function of the features listed in (a) to the plant.</p><p>(b) Explain the term: ecological succession</p><p>(c) By means of a diagram only, outline the carbon cycle to show the relative importance of the cycle to life in general.<br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) Morphological features of Tropical rainforest plants:</strong></p><ul>\n<li>They are tall trees with unbranched trunks which taper very little.</li>\n<li>Usually their barks are thin and they have buttresses.</li>\n<li>The leaf buds lack protective covering while the matured leaves are oval in shape, having entire margins and an acumen or drip tip.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Functions of features listed: </strong></p><ul>\n<li>Tall unbranched trunks enable the plants to receive adequate sunlight .</li>\n<li>Thin bark allows the plant to lose water by transpiration and makes the trees a good source of timber.</li>\n<li>Buttress roots provide mechanical support against wind.</li>\n<li>Buds lack protective covering and this encourages easy breakage for the buds.</li>\n<li>Drip tip type of leaves allows water to drain easily from the leaves, hence transpiration is facilitated.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>(ii) Morphological features of plants in the Savanna: </strong></p><ul>\n<li>They have long twisted roots and thick bark.</li>\n<li>Trunks are gnarled (covered with hard lumps) and twisted.</li>\n<li>Because of the underground stems, grasses are tuff and perennial.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Functions of features listed:</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Long twisted roots facilitate the absorption of water and mineral salts and also facilitate quick regeneration after fire attack.</li>\n<li>Thick bark enables the plants to withstand harsh conditions, e.g. fire.</li>\n<li>Gnarled and twisted trunk reduce excessive loss of water as well as resistance to fire attack .</li>\n<li>Underground stems enable the plants to survive during dry season and fire attack.</li>\n<li>Tuffs and perennial Grasses have inner parts which are highly protected by the outer tuffness against fire outbreak.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>(b) </strong>Ecological succession can be referred to as a gradual, cumulative and predictable progressive change in the ecological communities in an area with a definite movement toward a position of equilibrium known as climax. It can be classified into primary and secondary succession. Primary succession is the colonization of borne vegetation or bare ground or rocks which have not previously been colonized, e.g. surfaces of fresh hardened molten magma and sand dunes. Secondary succession is the colonization of an area following the destruction or removal of the original vegetation. Barren habitat is gradually colonized by a series of plant and animal inhabitants until a final stable community is achieved. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/89%202.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:300px\"></p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) List three functions of the kidney.</p><p>(b) Make a labelled diagram of the mammalian kidney tubule (nephron)</p><p>(c) Describe how the kidney carries out two of the functions listed in (a). <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)Functions of the kidney: </strong><br>\n(1) Serves as excretory organ, e.g. urine<br>\n(2) As osmoregulatory organ<br>\n(3) Homeostasis<br>\n(4) Formation of urine<br>\n(5) Elimination of toxins, drugs and.harmful substances<br>\n(6) Heat production<br>\n(7) Water level regulator.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/89%203.jpg\" style=\"height:309px; width:300px\"></p><p> (c)(i)<strong> Osmo regulation:</strong> Kidney keeps the composition of the body plasma constant by means of osmosis, e.g. if there is too much water in the plasma, the kidneys excrete more water and thus reduce the amount in the plasma. In this way, the osmotic pressure of the plasma is kept constant by the kidney and this is important because, in this way, the balance of osmotic pressure between the blood and cells through the intermediate lymph is maintained. Normally the composition of the plasma is controlled or varied as a result of the amount  of water and soluble substances absorbed from the alimentary canal or lost through sweating. The variation  is corrected by the kidney.The osmotic pressure of the blood may rise due to too much water loss or excess salt intake. This is detected by sensitive cells in the hypothalamus of the brain which stimulate the production and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary gland. As soon as the hormone reaches the kidney, it induces the kidney tubules to reabsorb more water from the glomerular filtrate into the blood, making the urine Cortex more concentrated and thus, reducing more loss of water  from the blood. This state helps to maintain the osmotic pressure of the blood.</p><p>(C)(ii)<strong> Excretion of urine: </strong>The unit of excretion is the nephron. Waste products are transported from the.renal artery to the kidney. Inside the Bowman's capsule is the glomerulus which serves as the ultrafilteration of the waste products. The filterate is transported down the kidney tubules. In the loop shaded position of the tubule, more salts are added to the fluid while water is removed from it, resulting in the formation of urine. The urine moves to the bladder by peristatsis and is stored until it is ready to be expelled. <br>\n </p>",
