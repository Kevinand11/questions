        "answer": "<p>(a) Explanation of chemical weathering of rocks: <br>\nChemical weathering is the decomposition of rocks by chemical agents formed through the reaction of water with atmospheric gases such as air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) As some minerals in the rocks are dissolved and others change into new chemical products therefore disintegration of rocks occurs. <br>\n<br>\n(b)Discussion of chemical weathering of rocks (Any four) <br>\n<strong>Hydration </strong><br>\nOccurs when water combines with or binds to some minerals Intact water may bind to silicates, oxides of iron <br>\nHydrated compounds are soft and easily fragmented It does not usually affect the chemical composition of the hydrated product <br>\nExample of hydration reaction are <br>\nFe203  + 3H20  <img src=\"https://waeconline.org.ng/e-learning/Agriculture/Agric219mq3_clip_image001_0000.png\" style=\"height:12px; width:49px\">      .
