        "answer": "<p>(a) Diagram of the stomach of a named ruminant e.g Goat, Sheep, Cattle</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan1.jpg\" style=\"height:199px; width:340px\"></p><p>The rumen (pounch): It has several tongue-like projections called papillae. It also has a soft towel-like appearance. It is the largest and the first compartment of the stomach.</p><p>Reticulum (honeycomb): This is lined with a mucosal layer which is formed into hexagonal chamber that looks like honeycomb. It is the second compartment. Omasum (manypiles):</p><p>The omasum is the third and small-est compartment. It has several \"leaves\" or laminae/layers.</p><p>Abomasum: This is the only glandular stomach. It is synonymous with simple stomach of monogastric animals. The abomasum is the fourth and last compartment of the stomach.</p><p>(b) Functions of the first compartment (the rumen) of the stomach of a ruminant are: (i) Fermentation brought about by micro-organisms takes place in the rumen. (ii) It is used for temporary storage of feed before regurgitation for proper rechewing. (iii) volatile fatty acids and other gases are produced in the rumen as a result of fermentation. (iv) Absorption of volatile fatty acids takes place through the walls of the rumen. (v) Some vitamins, e.g. vitamin B, are produced in the rumen. (vi) Breakdown of cellulose takes place in rumen.Â </p>",
