The total population is 120 million. The official school-leaving age is 18 years while the official retiring age is 55 years.<br>\n(a) From the above information, calculate the:<br>\n(i) Population of children between 0 and 17 years.<br>\n(ii) population of old people (55 + years);<br>\n(iii) work-ing population (18 - 54 years) .</p><p>(b) what is the economic implication of the above population structure?<br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) Population of children between 0 and 17 years =\\(\\frac{162}{360} \\times \\frac{120}{1}\\)  = 54 million</p><p>(ii) Population of old people (55 + years)<br>\n= \\(\\frav{108}{360} \\timees \\frac{120}{1}\\)  = 36 million</p><p>(iii) Working Population (18 - 54 years) = \\(\\frac{90}{360} \\times \\frac{120}{1}\\) = 30 million</p><p>(b) The population structure in (a) above shows that the dependency ratio is high. Out of the total population of 120 million, the population of the dependant is 90 million. The economic implications are:<br>\n(i) The working populations will pay higher amount of tax to take care of the dependants.<br>\n(ii) The larger the group of de-pendants, the greater the expenditure on health service etc.<br>\n(iii) When the proportion of children and the aged is larger, less income is saved and hence there would be less investment.<br>\n(iv) There will be low level of investment.<br>\n(v) Prices of goods will rise as a result of increase in demand.<br>\n(vi) The standard of living will fall as many people will be fed by the small number of working population. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)Change in quantity demanded is any movement along the same demand curve, whether downwards or upwards. A downward movement along the demand curve signifies an increase in the quantity demanded when the price is reduced, while upward movement signifies a decrease in the quantity demanded when the price is raised. This is illustrated below. From the diagram, when the price increase to p\\(_2\\), there is - contraction in quantity demanded to Q\\(_1\\). When the price falls to P\\(_1\\), the quantity demanded increase to Q\\(_2\\). Price is the only factor that brings that change in the quantity demanded while other factors are held constant.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/91%202%281%29.jpg\" style=\"height:310px; width:200px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/91%2022%282%29.jpg\" style=\"height:208px; width:200px\"><br>\n(b) Change in demand is a complete shift of the demand curve forward or backward. An increase in demand induces a shift of the demand curve to the right, while a decrease in demand will cause a shift of the entire demand curve to the left. Therefore, a change in any of the other factors ,except price, that influence demand will cause a shift of the demand curve to a new position. These shifts in demand is illustrated below. In figure, the demand curve has shifted to the right, this‘shows an increase in demand. In figure 2 the demand curve has shifted to the left, this shows a decrease in demand.<br>\n </p>",
