(4 arks)</p><p>(b) Interpret your answer in question 2(a) above. (2 marks)</p><p>(c) Study the extract below and answer the following questions. The price of palm oil remains at $6.00 per gallon and an increase in the price of a related product causes an increase in the supply of palm oil:<br>\n(i) Give a graphical presentation to illustrate this change.
