For example, at price OP\\(_1\\), OQ\\(_2\\) was supplied while OQ\\(_3\\) was demanded.</p><p>(iii) If the price is at a level where supply is greater than demand (above equilibrium), there would be excess supply, leading to a fall in price. For example, at price OP\\(_2\\), OQ\\(_4\\) was supplied while OQ\\(_1\\)  was demanded.</p><p>(iv) The equilibrium price is OP\\(_0\\) where demand is equal to supply. There is no tendency for price to change. The quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded at OQ\\(_0\\)</p>",
