        "answer": "<p>(a) Stages in the Life Cycle of Liver Fluke; - Egg. - Sporocyst. - Cercaria/metacercaria. - Miracidium. - Radiae. - Adult</p><p>(b) Effects of Liver Fluke on Farm Animals; - Inflammation of the liver/sores. - Obstruction/blockage of the bile duct. - Liver haemorrhage/loss of blood/anaemia. - Loss of coordination/weakness. -Digestive disturbance/diarrhoea. - Damage to other organs during migration/reduction in metabolism of nutrients. - Reduced productivity i.e reduced growth/egg production/milk yield/fertility/wool production</p><p>(c) Control of Liver Fluke in Farm Animals; - Destroy snails by treating surrounding water with moluscides/copper sulphate. - Use of ducks, geese to eat the snails. - Prevent animals from grazing on wet pasture/swamp. Use rotational grazing. - Apply lime to stop the hatching of eggs on pasture/burning pasture. - Maintain good sanitary practices/give clean uncontaminated forage and water. - Deworm/treat infected animals.</p><p>(d).</p><p> <img alt=\"Open Photo\" src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/s240x240/240205737_394722415356566_3520894735774867693_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=aee45a&amp;_nc_eui2=AeFfBg9znZS3aeORHBGhFWaMAIlSua13zLIAiVK5rXfMshMlMfv7lgKffFn99PUH-kcUVKe_I8YA14xc5XtiHAEo&amp;_nc_ohc=DoX5rAWh6nEAX8-DQ96&amp;_nc_ad=z-m&amp;_nc_cid=0&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.xx&amp;oh=44207feec95efae32b291a9f795ca9c2&amp;oe=614A2D79\"></p><p> </p>",
