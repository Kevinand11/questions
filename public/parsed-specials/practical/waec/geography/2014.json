This band travels through a very short distance at the same time, this band falls or heat up a smaller surface area, this results in the equatorial regions being hotter , the sun's rays fall obliquely on the surface in the temperature latitudes, this band travels a longer distance and much of the heat is lost to clouds, water vapour and dust particles, the rays in the temperate latitudes heat up a larger area than that of the tropics, this results in the temperate latitudes having lower temperatures</p><p>(c) Lapse rate is 6.5ºC for every 1000m of ascent.<br>\n6000m will have a lapse rate of <ins>(6.5 X 6000)</ins>ºC 1000 = 39ºC<br>\ntemperature at sea level = 40ºC<br>\ntemperature at height 6000m will be (40 - 39)ºC = 1ºC</p>",
