        "answer": "<p>1.(i) Accommodation is the ability of the eye to focus (both near and distant) objects on the retina or the ability to see clearly (far and near) objects. It is also the adjustments of tne focal length of the eye to see clearly. (i) Metamorphosis is a process by which organisms change or develop from egg to adult.</p><p>2. The wall of the left ventricle is thicker because the left ventricle pumps (oxygenated) blood to more parts of the body than the right ventricles. Right ventricle pumps Blood only to the lungs while the left ventricle pumps blood to the other parts of the body.</p><p>3. In a diabetic person, there is either insufficient or inadequate or no insulin at all to convert the excess sugar to glycogen for storage in tne Liver. This causes excess sugar to be contained in the urine.</p><p>4. Vasopressin or Anti-diuretic Hormones (ADH) controls the reabsorption of water in the kidney.</p><p>5. Hemoglobin has an affinity for oxygen with which it combines loosely to form oxyhaemoglobin. In the tissues, the oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to release oxygen in the cells for tissue respiration or internal respiration.</p><p>6(a) The aim of the experiment is to demonstrate osmosis in a living tissue or to demonstrate that water moves from the region of higher concentration through a semi-permeable or selective permeable membrane. (b) The liquid labeled I is water Yam potato. pawpaw, pig's bladder or cocoyam can be used as a living tissue.</p><p>(d)(i) The level of the solution in A will rise while the level of B will remain the same.  (ii) In the soup A, the trough has a higher concentration of water molecules than the sugar solution, so there is a movement of water molecules rough through the living tissues into the sugar solution. OR there is a higher osmotic pressure in the sugar solution than in the trough, so water molecules move from the trough through the cells of the living tissues into the sugar solution. In set-up B, the concentration of water molecules are the same in the trough and in the yam cup.</p><p>(e) Set up B serves as a control.</p><p>7.(a) A pest is an organism (living organism) which harms or causes damage to man, his animals, crops or possession (b) Aphid attacks orange, citrus, cocoa, banana. cowpea. beans. beetles attacks banana, yam, bean, coconut, cocoa, palms. Weevils cereal crops. attack grains, beans, rice, corn, millet. Grasshopper/ Locust attacks cassava, all crops. Stem borer attacks maize, cocoa plant, Cocoa, Cotton cereal Crops. Mealy bug attacks cassava, mango bitter leaf. (African) armyworm attacks rice, sorghum, guinea crops. Rodents attacks tubers, maize, groundnut, sugarcane stem. Termites attacks any named plant. Cotton stainners attack cotton. Caterpiller attacks vegetables.</p><p>8. Hydrophyte or with air water lettuce or Pistia (b) Light body (ii) poorly developed strengthening tissue (iii) presence of alir spaces, spongy tissue and presence of parenchvma, (iv) presence of poorly developed conducting tissue (V) presence of thin cuticle or absence of cuticle (vi) presence of stomata only on the upper of the leaf (vii) presence of stolon (viii) presence of fibrous roots for water absorption.</p><p>9.(a) Specimen A is Cockroach while Specimen B is Earthworm (i) Specimen A is found in dark corners, Crevices, shelves,  Cupboards, cartons containing food stuff or books, dirty toilet. Specimen B is found in damp or humid soil, mud and moist soil.</p><p> </p><p><img alt=\"Open photo\" src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/s180x540/248425836_221675643365385_8087578515724222926_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=aee45a&amp;_nc_eui2=AeEQt7D2Xowdx1lcUIQTcVfwrEmKbGp76IysSYpsanvojEWr1HbTctjgMGR4cy2f7FNUMoyE3pUtNfarHADUFA8T&amp;_nc_ohc=lLIU71iom8UAX_HHJON&amp;_nc_ad=z-m&amp;_nc_cid=0&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.xx&amp;oh=f3e7fa737fd08e8cd688dae56e46c20e&amp;oe=619F09B7\"></p><p>(c) Differences between specimen A and B are: Cockroach (Specimen A)</p><p>(i)Body is divided into head, thorax and abdomen,(ii) Antenna present (iii) Legs present iv) Wings present (v) Eyes present (vi) Clitellum absent (vi) Chaetae/setae absent (vii) Distinct head present.</p><p>Earthworm</p><p>(Specimen Body not divided into head, thorax and abdomen (not divided into three (three regions.) regions), Legs absent, Wings absent, Eye absent, Clitellum present, Chaetae/setae present, Distinct head absent.</p><p>(d) Specimen A is a disease vector.
