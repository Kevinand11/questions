        "answer": "<p>(ai) Rotation of the earth- the movement of the earth on its axis, the earths rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, the earth rotates from west to east, the speed of rotation is approximately 4.7 km per second at the equator 2.3 km per second at latitude 60°, earth completes its rotation in 24hours.<br>\n(ii) Revolution of the earth- movement of the earth around the sun earth takes 365¼ days to complete a revolution. The path along which the earth revolves is callled the orbit, the orbit is elliptical and oval shaped, average distance between the earth and the sun is 148,800.008 km. Revolving earth is inclined at an angle of 66¹/²° to the plain of the ecliptic<br>\n(iii) Equinox- equal day and equal night all over the world , occurs twice a year , march 21st and september 23rd. Mid day sun is directly overhead at equator, maybe in the spring autumn, in northern hemisphere, spring Equinox occurs on march 21st, in southern hemisphere, spring Equinox occurs on september 23rd.</p><p>(b) Effects of the revolution of the earth- marking of thr year causes change in seasons, changes in the altitude of the mi-day sum, varying lengths of day and night.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Landforms found in the upper course of a river are gorge, v-shaped valley, and waterfall</p><p>(b) Characteristics of an ox-box lake landform,feature of lower course of a river occurs in marshy areas horse-shoe in shape shallow convex bank deep concave bank.Formation of an ox-bow lake formed in the lower course of a river, formed due to pronounced meanders, erosion on the concave bank, deposition on the convex bank, neck becomes very narrow, river breaks through the narrow neck during floods, leads to deposition of sediment at the entrance of the loop results in a cut off lake called ox-bow lake.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Climate is the average weather condition of a place over a long period of time, usually between 30 and 35 years</p><p>(b) (i)Torrid zone: This zone is found within the tropis,the zone is very hot,it has high temperature throughout the year (ii)Temperate zone: This zone is found between the torrid and frigid zones, it has mild or moderate temperature (iii)Frigid zone: This zone is found in the polar regions (Arctic and antarctic regions).</p><p>(c) (i) It is very simple to understand (ii)It is objective (iii)It is quantitative because numerical values are used for defining boundaries of climatic group (iv)It is commonly used in teaching at various levels of educational institutions (v)It uses more than one parameter for classification.</p>",
