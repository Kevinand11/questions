All lines of latitudes are parallel while lines of longitudes converge at the poles, lines of latitude decrease in length from the equator towards the pole while all lines of longitudes are of equal length, lines of longitudes increase in value from the equator towards the pole while lines of longitudes increase in value eastwards and westwards of the greenwich meridian</p>",

This band travels through a very short distance at the same time, this band falls or heat up a smaller surface area, this results in the equatorial regions being hotter , the sun's rays fall obliquely on the surface in the temperature latitudes, this band travels a longer distance and much of the heat is lost to clouds, water vapour and dust particles, the rays in the temperate latitudes heat up a larger area than that of the tropics, this results in the temperate latitudes having lower temperatures</p><p>(c) Lapse rate is 6.5ºC for every 1000m of ascent.<br>\n6000m will have a lapse rate of <ins>(6.5 X 6000)</ins>ºC 1000 = 39ºC<br>\ntemperature at sea level = 40ºC<br>\ntemperature at height 6000m will be (40 - 39)ºC = 1ºC</p>",
