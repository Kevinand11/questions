        "explanation": "<p><strong>Amos</strong>, herdsman of Tekoa, was sent from God with a powerful <strong>message</strong> of correction for the ancient House of Israel. In spite of withering opposition, he fearlessly indicted the nation for its hollow, meaningless piety, social injustice and general immorality. His message was to warn the nation of Israel, who had gotten arrogant and hardened toward the poor and oppressed that He was going to judge them by having their enemies conquer them. Israel's relationship with God was unique but not exclusive.  In commencement, doom is defined as judgement.Given this definetion and in line with the topic under discussion it cannot be dismissed as far fetched to suppose that Amos was a prophet of doom. It can be argued that doom is at the core of Amos' message and this doom came as a result of various sins which were commited by the lsraelite nation.These sins include rampant corruption in the courts,social injustice as well as idolatry. It must be pointed out that these sins breeched the covenant between yahweh and the israelite. As a result this has led many scholars to argue that Amos indeed was a prophet of doom.While acknowledging that Amos was a prophet of doom it will be a misnormer of judgement to conclude along those lines. A closer glance at Amos book can lead one to point out that Amos was a prophet of hope.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",
