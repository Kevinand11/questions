Conversely, in a parliamentary system, the executive is named by the legislature, on which he or she depends for continuance in office. The national executive encompasses the dual roles of head of state and head of government. In a<em><strong> presidential system</strong></em>, these two roles—the first a ceremonial one representing the nation and the second the administrator of the government—are joined in a single person.
