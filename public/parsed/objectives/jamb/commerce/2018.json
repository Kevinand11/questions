However, it can limit expansion options if you don't have enough cash available to proceed with your plans. the following are some sources of internal funding; </p><ol>\n<li><strong>Retained Profits: </strong>The term \"retained profit\" often refers to large companies with shareholders and stock, who decide to recycle profit as working capital rather than paying it out as dividends.</li>\n<li><strong>sales os assets: </strong>If your business has equipment lying around that you don't use, you can raise working capital by selling these items and then funneling the proceeds back into your business as working capital. </li>\n<li><strong>reducing working capital :</strong> Reducing working capital is a strategy based on managing your available money more closely. If you can negotiate shorter billing times with your clients and longer payment terms with your suppliers, you'll receive funds faster and pay them out more slowly, leaving you with more money for day-to-day operations.</li>\n</ol>",
