Basically, what this means is that as an economy devotes more of its resources to one kind of product, it becomes less efficient because, not all resources are equally suitable for all the industries. If resources are transferred from good A to B, initially the resources to be transferred will be those which could be the least efficient for A. Later, as more of good B needs to be produced, the resources that may be very efficient for good B and not so efficient for good B may also be transferred. In this situation, the economy loses on both sides. That means, the economy is usually inefficient on both ends of the PPC curve while it is the most efficient when resources are appropriately allocated for both goods according to their suitability which make the PPC to be curved. This is why the PPC is flatter at its end point and more curved in the middle.",

        "explanation": "Zero-Based budgeting and traditional budgeting are the two predominantly used budgeting techniques. Zero-based budgeting is a budgeting method where current year’s budget is prepared from the scratch i.e. taking the base as zero. The old and the new activities of the business are ranked according to their importance and based on that, resources are allocated to each activity without considering the past budgets or achievements.<br><br>Traditional budgeting is a method of preparation of the budget in which the last year’s budget is taken as the base. Current year’s budget is prepared by making changes to previous year’s budget by adjusting the expenses based on the inflation rate, consumer demand, market situation etc.<br><br>In case of zero-based budgeting, it is easy to eliminate an existing item or add a new item to the current budget, as zero-based budgeting is a creation of entirely new budget from the ground. In other words, zero-based budgeting is more flexible in nature.",
