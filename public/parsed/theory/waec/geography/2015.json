This amount of time is the definition of one year. The gravitational pull of the Sun keeps <strong>Earth</strong> and the other planets in orbit around the star.</p><p>3.An equinox is commonly regarded as the instant of time when the plane of Earth's equator passes through the geometric center of the Sun's disk. This occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September. In other words, it is the moment at which the center of the visible Sun is directly above the equator.</p><p>(b)<strong>Effects</strong> of <strong>Earth's revolution</strong> include the seasons and variation in the length of days and nights. In addition to <strong>revolution</strong>, the tilt of <strong>Earth's</strong> axis relative to its plane of orbit has a profound <strong>effect</strong> on <strong>Earth</strong>.
