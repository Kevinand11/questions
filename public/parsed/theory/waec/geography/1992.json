        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) (i) Equinoxes: </strong>Refers to two particular days of the year when all parts of the world will experience equal days and nights. These two days are March 21st and September 23rd. During these two days, the sun is vertically overhead at the equator and all parts of the earth will experience equal days and equal nights.</p><p><strong>(ii) Great Circles: </strong>Any circle which divides a globe into two equal parts (or hemispheres) is a great circle. Examples are the equator, Greenwich meridian, meridian 180°, meridians 10°E and 170°W. 50°E and 130°W. etc. are all great circles. The number of great circles is limitless. It can extend east to west, north to south and so on provided it divides the globe into hemispheres.</p><p><strong>(b) The reason(s) why the period of twilight is longer along the Arctic circle than at the Equator; </strong><br>\nThe brief period between sun set and complete darkness is called twilight. This is caused by the fact that during the period of twilight, the earth receives diffused or refracted light from the sun while it is still below the horizon. Since the sunrises and sets in a vertical path at the Equator, the period during which refracted light is received is short. But at the arctic circle, the sun rises and sets in an obligue path and the period of refracted light is longer. It is much longer still at the poles. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) The differences between deflation and abrasion are as follows;</strong><br>\nDeflation involves the lifting and blowing away of loose materials from the ground. Such unconsolidated sands and pebbles may be carried in the air or rolled along the ground depending on the size while abrasion involves the sand blasting of rock surfaces by winds when they hurl sand particles against them. The effect of sand blasting results in rock surfaces being scratched, polished and worn away.</p><p>(b) One landform produced by deflation is the deflation hollows. Deflation results in the lowering of the land surface gradually until large depressions are formed called deflation hollows. One landform produced by abrasion is the Rock pedestals. The sand blasting effect of winds against any projecting rock masses wears back the soft layers so that an irregular edge is formed on the alternate bands of hard and soft rocks. Grooves and hollows are cut in the rock surfaces, carving them into fantastic pillars called rock pedestals.</p><p><strong>(c) Two reasons why wind erosion is more active in arid than in humid regions. </strong></p><p>(i) In arid regions like the desert, wind erosion is more active because of absence of vegetation. Absence of vegetation enables the-wind to move at high speed thereby causing wind erosion.</p><p>(ii) Absence of moisture to bind the soil particles together. Since there is no moisture, the soil particles are loosely held hence they can easily be carried away by winds.<br>\n </p>",
