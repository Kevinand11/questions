        "question": "<p> Write explanatory notes on each of the following</p><p>(a) Land and sea breezes</p><p>(b) Temperature inversion</p><p>(c) Convectional rainfall <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) Land And Sca Freezes:</strong> Breeze exchange between the land and the sea is attributed to differential heating of land and sea. These local wind are common in areas very close to the sea. During the day, the land is heated much faster than the sea and it is cooler than the sea at night. As the land is heated during the day, it causes the air to rise, creating a low pressure situation. Air therefore blows from the sea to replace the heated and rising air on the land thereby resulting in lower temperature and relatively cool air on the land. This is sea breeze which blows from sea to land. At night, the land becomes cooler that-. the sea having lost much of its temperature at a much faster rate than the sea. Thus, there is a high pressure situation on the land and a relatively low pressure situation on the sea. Hence a land breeze blows from the land to the sea.</p><p><strong>(b) Temperati.re inversion: </strong>This is the opposite of lapse rate and it means a rise in temperature with increasing altitude. It is not in all cases that temperature decreases with altitude. Temperature could be lower at the sea-level especially in valleys almost enclosed by mountains than at heights above such valley E.g temperature inversion is found in European Alps where cold and heavy al: collects in valleys which are almost totally enclosed by mountains</p><p><strong>(c) Convectional rainfall: </strong>This is the main type of rainfall in the humid tropics. The heat generated by the sun is aL;le to make the surroundings including the sea and ocean to be hot. Because the air is hot, it is able to absorb very large amount of moisture. The warm and moist air is forced to rise rapidly by convection current. When the current rises very high and reaches the cold layers of the atmosphere which make it conducive for the moisture contained in tha currents to condense, rainfall immediately fo: ows the condensation of the moisture. This type of rain formed by this process is called convectional rainfall. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>The important features of Koppen; </strong>climatic classification is based on vegetation. It attempts to explain the variation of earth's climate by studying the connection between vegetation and climate. Koppean's classification of climates consists of five major climatic groups which are</p><p>A- This is moist and hot climate e.g tropical rainy climates with avenge mz.nthly temperature of above 18°C. This climate has no winter seasons. Annual rainfall is large and exceeds annual evaporation.</p><p>B - This is dry climate in which potential evaporation exceeds precipitation. Since there is no water surplus, no permanent streams originate in B climatic zones.</p><p>C - This refers to moist and warm climate e.g warm temperate climate, whose coldest month has an average temperatures of under 18°C but has above 3°C in at least one month. It has both summer  and winter seasons.</p><p>D - This is snowy and cold climate (cold - snow forest climate). The average temperature of its coldest month is under 3°C. The average temperature of the warmest month is above 10°C</p><p>E -This is polar icy climate (snow climate). The average temperature of its warmest month is below 10°C. This climate has no true summer. In order to differentiate between sub-divisions within these major groups, secondary letters are assigned to furnish more complete explanation e.g</p><p>F - moist all year<br>\nM -monsoon conditions<br>\nS - dry summer wet winter<br>\nV - dry winter, wet summer.</p><p>A third letter was added to include information about temperature e.g</p><p>a - long hot su. rimer<br>\nb - short, warm summer<br>\nc - short and moderate or cool summer<br>\nd - very cold am; dry winter<br>\nh - hot and dry most of the year<br>\nk - cold and dry most of the year.</p><p>This is how these letters are assigned to climatic belts e.g polar and sub-polar (sub arctic) regions begin with the letter E, to which are added either T (for tundra vegetation and conditions). The dry climates are assigned the letter W and S to differentiate between desert (BW) and steppe (BS) climate and vegetation conditions. BWK would refer to cool desert climate while DFe would refer to cold snowy forest climate with cool short summer.<br>\n </p>",

Market is one of the factors affecting the location of industries. Industry will not be located where there is no market. Industries are located in areas of high population density because of the high purchasing power of the urban dwellers.

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) Cocoa growing in Western Nigeria:</strong> Cocoa is cultivated in the Western Nigeria especially in Oyo, Ogun and Ondo States because cocoa grows best under certain conditions present in these areas which are undulating and well drained land, temperature of about 27°C, rainfall of 125-200cm, abundant sunshine for drying the beans, abundant labour to work in the cocoa farm and easy disposal of produce through sea ports. Crops sowed mature within five years. Harvested pods are crushed,beans fermented, dried and bagged for export.</p><p><strong>(b) Oil palm production in the Eastern States:</strong> Oil palm is produced in the east like Owerri, Aba, Port Harcourt, etc. The crop grows best in temperature of not less than 21°C rainfall of 150-300cm, brilliant sunshine, deep loamy soil coupled with abundance of cheap labour. The crop is grown from the nuts, matures within 5-10 years and the matured fruits or bunch are harvested; processed and the products are palm oil and palm kernel which are used locally or exported.</p><p><strong>(c) Rice cultivation in the Middle Belt: </strong>Rice is cultivated mainly as food crop for internal trade. Swamp rice is the type that is mainly grown in the middle belt of Nigeria such as Lafiagi, Badeggi and Pategi areas of the Niger valley. The seeds, are first raised in nursery and later transplanted to the Niger valley where the Niger has flooded its valley. They rice grows between 3-4 months after which it is harvested, processed and sold to local buyers.</p><p><strong>(d) Intensive Farming in the Kano close - settled Zone;</strong> Intensive farming is practised in Kano as a result of high population. This high population results in land fragmentation hence farmers have to maximise the use of the small land through farming. During the farming seasons, they apply fertilizers and manure to promote the growth of crops and most of the crops grown are mainly cereals e.g millet, sorghum, maize <br>\n </p>",
