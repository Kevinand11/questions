        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) Dispersed settlement</strong>: This form of settlement is made up of several houses which are scattered or dispersed in nature. One house may be up to one or more kilometres from the next. It is associated with rural farming and farmlands are usually behind buildings Farmlands are intensively tilled. <br>\nDispersed settlements are mainly engaged in primary activities with few social amenities. It presents a quiet social life </p><p><strong>(ii) Linear settlement</strong> This form of settlement stretches along physical features such as elongated escarpment, lakes, etc. It could be straight or curved communication lines along railways, roads, foot paths, etc. Linear settlement is mainly rural in nature which may constitute extension of towns on their outskirts It could be sublinear where roads meet and are of several kilometres in length. <br>\nGardens are located behind the houses while farmlands exist behind gardens. </p><p><strong>(b) Factores that favor the location of settlements</strong><br>\n(i) Location at a river confluence, e.g Lokoja (Nigeria). Khartoun (Sudan) St Louis (USA) <br>\n(ii) Location at where a river is shallow or narrow. e.g Oxford (England), Paris (France), Rome (Italy) <br>\n(iii) Location at the exit or the entrance of gorges e.g. Bingen and Bonn (Germany) <br>\n(iv) Location at river bend or meander, e.g Telok Anson on tne Perak River Meander (Malaysia). Orleans on River Rhone (France) <br>\n(v) Location at where there is an Indentation on the coast line. eg Lagos (Nigeria), Freetown (Sierra Leone) RIO de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Tokyo (Japan)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>(c) Functions of Urban Settlements </strong><br>\n(i) Provides social services <br>\n(ii) Commercial functions <br>\n(iii) Provision of employment Serves and residential function <br>\n(v) Serves as administrative/political function (vi) Educational centres <br>\n(viii) Individual function</p>",
