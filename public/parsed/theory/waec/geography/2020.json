        "question": "<p> (a)Outline five reasons for industrial localization</p><p>(b) Explain five benefits of establishing manufacturing industries in rural areas?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Reasons for industrial localization:</p><p>(i) Availability of infrastructural facilities: The presence of electricity, pipe borne water, telephone, etc. also contributes to industrial localization.</p><p>(ii) Nearness to raw materials: This is a dominant factor in the location of an industry, especially that industry which uses bulky raw material that is expensive to transport and looses weight in the manufacturing process.</p><p>(iii) Availability of finance/capital: This is the live wire of every industry. Industries are located in areas where there is access to banking and financial facilities. Such areas attract more industries:</p><p>(iv) Nearness to markets: An entrepreneur has to consider the market potentialities of his/her product. Nearness to markets will reduce the cost of transporting products to the markets.</p><p>(v) Availability of adequate and trained labour: Industries tend to be concentrated in those areas where adequate supplies of trained labour are available.</p><p>(vi) Nearness to sources of power: There should be enough, ready and dependable sources of power. This will help the operation of the industry.</p><p>(vii) Adequate transport network: This is highly essential to move raw materials to industrial sites, and to move the finished goods to the markets or areas of consumption.</p><p>(viii) Political stability: This enhances industrial growth and attracts foreign investments.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Benefits of establishing manufacturing industries in rural areas:</p><p>(i) Development of rural areas: It helps in developing the rural areas.</p><p>(ii) Discouragement of rural-urban migration: Rural-urban migration is discouraged.</p><p>(iii) Provision of employment to skilled and unskilled labour: It leads to employment of skilled and unskilled labour.</p><p>(iv) Increased production of goods: It brings about an increase in the production of goods because of being close to raw materials, e.g. producers of beverages such as Bournvita, Milo, etc.</p><p>(v) Increased earnings for rural people: People in rural areas can experience in their earnings.</p><p>(vi) Encouragement of urban-rural migration: It also encourages urban-rural migration, thereby reducing the rate of crimes in urban areas. </p>",
