        "answer": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%2022.jpg\" style=\"height:134px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Delta is a feature of lower course of rivers with many distributaries: It is actuate, bird foot or fan-shaped and low lying at the mouth of rivers. Examples are Niger delta, I Main Stream Nile, Mississippi.<br>\n<strong>Formation</strong>: Presence of tideless coast or (River Niger) sheltered coast, sluggish river with heavy deposition of silt at the mouth and availability of lowland areas towards the mouth Tributaries of a river.<br>\n<strong>Uses</strong>: Good agricultural land especially for cultivation' of rice, oil palms and raffia palms. It is also good for fishing and petroleum mining </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%2033.jpg\" style=\"height:123px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Two parallel consequent rivers with tributaries separated by a river more powerful and with presence of wind gap. Examples are River irrawady in India, River Ogunpa (Ibadan), in Nigeria.<br>\n<strong>Formation</strong>: One river erodes more aggressively than the other; the more powerful river makes greater rate of headward erosion. The more powerful river cuts through river divide then captures water of weaker stream. The lower part of the pirated stream now forms what is called misfit, the point of capture is termed elbow of capture and a wind gap is formed.<br>\n<strong>Uses</strong>: Rich in agricultural land with the vegetation always available for cattle. The wind gap serves as communication route. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/99%20333.jpg\" style=\"height:103px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Feature of upper course of river,with steep slope which forms plunge pool. Examples are Kwa fall, Victoria fall, Niagara fall, Erin-ljesa fall, etc<br>\n<strong>Formation:</strong> Resistant rock forms a bar across a river valley, fault line scarp lies across a river course, water plunges down the plateau edge, this may develop to form rapids. Undercutting softer rocks and water fall recedes upstream.</p><p><strong>(iv) Inselberg - Appearance:</strong> Is found in semi and / arid land form in isolated rocky out crops/composed of granite or gneiss, steep sided/may occur singly or in group round/flat topped-dome shaped. Polished surface/may rise up to over 500 metres with screes found at the base. Examples are Tibesti Plateau, ldanre Hill, Senna hill, Olumo hill, Ahaggar plateau, all in Northern Nigeria and Kalahari desert. Western Australia.<br>\n<strong>Formation:</strong> Formed in semi arid regions, mechanical weathering is dominant and extensive in old plateau(s). Weathering and removal of weathered materials by water and wind with the hard outcrops now exposed.<br>\n<strong>Uses: </strong>Tourism and quarrying <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) Winds: </strong>Warm winds raise the temperature of adjacent coastlands, e.g the westerlies bring warm air into Western Europe. Cold winds lower the temperature of adjacent coastlands e.g cold polar winds lower the temperature of the coasts of Newfoundland. Warm, moist winds from the ocean bring rainfall to the adjacent coastland, e.g S.W Monsoon in West Africa. Dry winds from the interior do not produce rain rather they produce dust and dryness, e.g Northeast trade wind brings no rain but dust and dryness to the coastal lands of West Africa. Off shore winds blowing from the interior to the coast produce fogs at the coast, e.g fog formation along the Namibian coast.</p><p><strong>(b) Ocean Current:</strong> Cold currents lower the temperature of adjacent coastlands e.g the Benguella current, currents help in <br>\nthe formation of foes along the coast e.g cold Benguela and Canaries current. Warm currents raise temperature of the adjacent coastlands e.g warm Guinea and warm Mozambican currents. Cold currents result in the formation of coastal deserts e.g Kalahari desert because of cold Benguela current, Sahara desert bec use of cold canaries current</p><p><strong>(c) Distance from the sea: </strong>Generally the further inland from the sea the less rainfall, e.g Freetown on the coast and Timbuktu inland. Smaller range of temperature along the coast than inland e.g Calabar (less than 30°C) and Agades (more than 15°C) Higher humidity along the coast than further inland generally (one town along the coast and any town inland). Thicker cloud cover along the coast than inland.</p>",

The sun is the source of all heat and measured with the aid of thermometer. It influences the actual amount of water vapour present in the air and also the rate of evaporation and condensation in the lower atmosphere Temperature decreases with heights</p><p><strong>(ii) Pressure: </strong>Consists of a number of mixed gases and has weight, exerts weight on the earth surface and this varies from place and from time to time. The higher one goes the lower the temperature and pressure. It is measured with a barometer.</p><p><strong>(iii) Cloud:</strong> Particles of water droplets in the upper atmosphere suspended in the air. Due to condensation of water vapour carried by rising air, clouds may give precipitation. Cloud reduces visibility and depletes solar insolation. Types include cirrus, cumulus, status, etc.</p><p><strong>(iv) Sunshine: </strong>Visible part of the solar energy and useful for plants and other living organisms. Determines how dry the wind is and aids the process of formation of clouds and rainfall. The amount of sunshine depends on latitude of a place and the slope of the land affects the amount/intensity of sunshine. Sunshine aspect may affect the amount/ intensity of sunshine. Sunshine varies according to season.</p><p><strong>(iv) Rainfall:</strong> Water droplets from the atmosphere. Occurs as a result of evaporation from water bodies, rivers, lakes, oceans and transportation from plants. Condensation reaches saturation point, dew point is finally reached. Amount of rainfall is measured with the aid of a language. Types of rainfall are convectional, orographic and cyclonic</p><p><strong>(vi) Wind: </strong>Air in motion, from high pressure to low pressure belts and has direction. It is made up of series of gusts and eddies, capable of carrying moisture, dust and other pollutants and it adapts to the characteristics of its immediate environment. Measured with wind vane (for direction) while the speed is measured with an anemometer</p><p><strong>(vii) Humidity: </strong>A measure of dampness of the atmosphere, water in the gaseous state; it varies from place to place at different times of the day.

When rainfall is less than 150cm and occurs mainly in summer the vegetation is often grass, e.g savanna and the veldts.

Clayey soils in areas of high rainfall gives rise to mangrove swamps e.g Niger Delta Areas with loamy soils and good rainfall gives rise to luxuriant vegetation e.g Rainforest belt. Sandy soils gives rise to poor grassland and desert, e.g Sahara desert <br>\n </p>",
