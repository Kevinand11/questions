        "question": "<p>a) Narrate the dreams of Pharaoh.</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what three ways did the interpretation of the dreams affect Joseph and his people?.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>A. THE DREAMS OF PHARAOH (GEN. 41:1-33)</p><p>i. Pharaoh dreamed of seven sleek and fat cows coming out of the Nile.</p><p>ii. He saw seven other slim and thin cows. </p><p>iii. The thin and slim cows swallowed the fat ones.</p><p>iv. He dreamed again of seven plump and good ears of corn growing in one stalk.</p><p>v. Another seven thin and blighted ears came up also.</p><p>vi. Again, the seven thin and blighted ears of corn ate up the good and plump ones.</p><p>vii. When he woke up, he was troubled and afraid.</p><p>viii. So he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt </p><p>ix. But his magicians and wise men could not interpret the dreams.</p><p>x. Then the chief butler remembered how Joseph had effectively interpreted his dreams in prison.</p><p>xi. The chief butler recommended Joseph to Pharaoh. </p><p>xii. Pharaoh narrated his dreams to Joseph.</p><p>xiii. Joseph emphasized that it is only God who gives favourable answer/interpretation to dreams.</p><p>xiv. Joseph gave good and acceptable interpretations to Pharaoh's dreams.</p><p> </p><p>B. WAYS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAMS AFFECTED JOSEPH AND HIS PEOPLE</p><p>i. Pharaoh made Joseph the leader of his household and people.</p><p>ii. Joseph was appointed next in rank to Pharaoh/ governor.</p><p>iii. Joseph was honoured with a royal marriage.</p><p>iv. He used his position to prepare adequately for famine.</p><p>v. He used his position to save his people during the period of famine.</p><p>vi. Reused his position to settle his family in Egypt during the period of famine.</p><p>vii. The episode brought reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers. `</p><p>viii. Through him, God's promise to Abraham was fulfilled because Joseph brought security and prosperity to his family in Egypt.</p><p>ix. It led to his freedom/release from prison. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>A. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE CALL OF DEBORAH TO BATTLE WITH JABIN (JUDGES 4)</p><p>I. The Israelites in the time of Joshua took a covenant/oath that they would not mix the worship of Yahweh with the worship of other gods.</p><p>ii. But, Israel defected from worshipping God alone and instead, served Baal and Ashtoreth, the gods of the Canaanites.</p><p>iii. Yahweh was displeased by this behaviour and thus, delivered Israel into the hands of their enemies who oppressed them severely and plundered them.</p><p>iv. Whenever they went to war, they were defeated as God had planned.</p><p>v. As a result of their suffering and punishment, the people prayed to God for deliverance from their oppressors.</p><p>vi. Yahweh was moved by the groaning of the oppressed Israelites and raised up Judges who delivered them from their enemies.</p><p>vii. However, when the Judges died, Israel went back to sin against God.</p><p>viii. Thus, the background to the call of Deborah followed a pattern of disobedience, punishment, prayer for forgiveness, and deliverance through one of the Judges.</p><p>ix. It was after the death of one of such Judges-(Ehud) that Israel sinned against God who gave them up to the Canaanite King- Jabin to oppress them for twenty years.</p><p>x. When Israel cried for mercy, God raised Deborah, a prophetess and a judge, to come to their rescue.</p><p>xi. Upon God's instructions, Deborah summoned Barak to gather 10,000 men at mount Tabor against Jabin and his army commander, Sisera. </p><p>xii. Deborah added that God had promised to give victory to Barak.</p><p>xiii. Barak, however insisted that he would go to the battle if only. Deborah went with him.</p><p>xiv. Deborah agreed but added that the victory would go to a woman.</p><p>xv. When Sisera heard that Israel had gone up to mount Tabor, he called up his men to fight Barak and Deborah, but the Canaanites were defeated.</p><p>xvi. After losing his entire army, Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the Kenite to seek asylum.</p><p>xvii. He was given hospitality but when he was asleep, Jael drove a peg into his throat with a hammer and killed him.</p><p>xviii. She presented his body to Barak who was pursuing Jabin.</p><p>xix. Jabin, the King of Canaan was also killed and the Israelites became free again and livel peacefully.</p><p>xx. This was in accordance with the principle of Deuteronomy that obedience to God leads to peace and prosperity, whereas disobedience leads to pain, suffering and defeat. </p><p> </p><p>B. WAYS WOMEN CAN CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</p><p>i. They are involved in social and religious activities. E.g evangelism</p><p>ii. Women are into politics and serve in government as MPs, etc.</p><p>iii. Women contribute to economic development as farmers etc.</p><p>iv. They can serve in various professions like medicine, banking, teaching, Law, army, Police, etc.</p><p>v. They are involved in rural and urban development.</p><p>vi. They are full time house wives involved in keeping the family together and bringing up children.</p><p>vii. There are women in soccer and other entertainments. </p>",

        "answer": "<p> A. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED DAVID TO SERVE IN THE HOUSE OF SAUL (1 SAMUEL 16:14-23)</p><p>i. In the war with the Amalekites, Saul was to utterly destroy the people and everything on the land (Holy war).</p><p>ii. Though Saul defeated the Amalekites and destroyed all the people, he spared Agag, the king of the Amalekites and the best of livestock to sacrifice to the Lord.</p><p>iii. Samuel told Saul that to obey is better than sacrifice and because Saul had rejected the word of the Lord, God had also rejected him from being King. </p><p>iv. After the disobedience of Saul, the Spirit of the Lord departed from him and he was tormented by an evil spirit from the Lord.</p><p>v. Saul's servant suggested that a man skillful in playing the lyre should be employed to help soothe Saul whenever he was tormented.</p><p>vi. Saul agreed to this suggestion and requested for the service of a skilled musician.</p><p>vii. One of the servants recommended David, son of Jesse, a Bethlehemite.</p><p>viii. David was described as a brave man and a warrior, one who speaks well and a fine man and that the Lord was with him.</p><p>ix. To this end, Saul sent messengers to Jesse that he needed David's services, because he was pleased with him.</p><p>x. Jesse gave David some bread, wine and a kid as a gift to Saul.</p><p>xi. David thereafter started working in the service of Saul.</p><p>xii. Saul loved David greatly and made him his armour-bearer.</p><p>xiii. He sent message to Jesse requesting David to remain in his service.</p><p>xiv. Whenever Saul was tormented, David played his lyre and Saul felt better, and the evil spirit left him.</p><p> </p><p>B. LESSONS LEADERS CAN LEARN FROM THE CAUSES OF SAUL'S DOWNFALL</p><p>i. Leaders must be obedient and loyal to God's instructions/sovereignty.</p><p>ii. Disobedience can terminate God's plans for one's life.</p><p>iii. Saul failed because he was moved by greed/ materialism. Therefore, leaders should not allow greed/ materialism to dominate their leadership.</p><p>iv. Disobedience leads to suffering and condemnation from God. Saul suffered greatly because God allowed evil spirit to torment him. He lost his life at the end.</p><p>v. One man's disobedience can lead to the suffering of others. The Israelites suffered defeat because of Saul.</p><p>vi. When they err, they should be ready to accept responsibility/the need to avoid shifting blames.</p><p>vii. When they are wrong, they should learn to correct their mistakes and seek for forgiveness.</p><p>viii. Obedience is better than sacrifice. It is better to prevent evil than to seek for solution or answer when it occurs.</p><p>ix. There is need for leaders to be prayerful.</p><p>x. Saul was dishonest or untruthful when he lied to Samuel that he had obeyed God's commandment. Leaders should avoid dishonesty/ deceit/insincerity and be truthful.</p><p>xi. Saul was a hypocrite for saying that he kept the animals to sacrifice to God. Leaders should avoid hypocrisy.</p><p>xii. Saul lacked courage to stand by the truth. Leaders should be courageous.</p><p>xiii. Leaders must be role models </p>",

After the discovery of the book of the law in the temple, King Josiah initiated some religious reforms.</p><p>ii. Josiah ordered Hilkiah, the priest to bring out all the vessels made for Baal and Asherah and all other gods. </p><p>iii. He burnt them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and took the ashes to Bethel.</p><p>iv. He deposed the idolatrous priests whom the king of Judah had ordained to burn incense in high places to honour Baal and other gods.</p><p>v. He broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which had taken over the house of the Lord.</p><p>vi. He went all over the city and defiled and chased out the high priests from the temple where they burned incense to the gods.</p><p>vii. He defiled Topheth to prevent people from sacrificing their sons and daughters as burnt offering to Moloch.</p><p>viii. He removed the horses the king of Judah had dedicated to the worship of the sun god at the entrance of the temple and burned them.</p><p>ix. He destroyed all the altars put in place by Manasseh, Solomon, Jeroboam and other kings before him.</p><p>x. Josiah carried out his reforms up to the Northern Kingdom; he removed the shrines of the high places that were in the city of Samaria Bethel which the Israelites had made.</p><p>xi. Josiah killed and burned the bodies of all the priests of the high places.</p><p>xii. He restored the Passover feast and the Sabbath and commanded the people to keep it as it was written in the book of the covenant/He restored the ancient faith.</p><p>xiii. He abolished idolatry, witchcraft, sorcery, soothsaying, divination from Judah! Jerusalem.</p><p>xiv.

        "answer": "<p>A. THE TEMPTATIONS OF JESUS AS RECORDED IN THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW (4:1-11)</p><p>i. After his baptism, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</p><p>ii. He fasted for forty days and nights and at the end of the fasting, He was hungry.</p><p>iii. The devil came to him saying, \"If you are the son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread\".</p><p>iv. Jesus replied that, \"It is written that: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'</p><p>v. The devil then took Him to the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, \"If you are the son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge of you,' / and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'</p><p>vi. And Jesus replied him, \"Again it is written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'</p><p>vii. The devil took Jesus to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</p><p>viii. He said to him, \"All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.\"</p><p>ix. Jesus rebuked the devil to go away, saying that one must worship only God.</p><p>x. Then the devil left Jesus.</p><p>xi. And the angels of the Lord came and ministered to Him.</p><p> </p><p> <br>\nB. WAYS THE TEMPTATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANT TO JESUS IN HIS MINISTRY</p><p>i. During his baptism, Jesus reflected on his mission as the Messiah! He examined all the popular ideas about the Messiah and his work and dismissed all of them.</p><p>ii. Through the temptations, Jesus accepted suffering as a means of achieving God's purpose, which was the redemption of mankind.</p><p>iii. With His victory over Satan, Jesus assured his followers that with the word of God, they too can overcome the devil.</p><p>iv. The temptations signaled the preparation of Jesus for his ministry It helped him to explore what his mission entailed. </p><p>v. The first temptation was to make Jesus an economic Messiah. One who would satisfy the physical and material needs of the people. Jesus however rejected the idea of bribing the people with material things or performing a miraculous feeding of the hungry and thereby gaining a large following.</p><p>vi. In the second temptation, Jesus rejected Satan's suggestion because it meant lack of absolute faith and trust in God! it was to make Jesus appear as a wonder worker confounding the people with his super natural power/gaining cheap popularity by performing miracles and wonders.</p><p>vii. The third temptation was to show Jesus as a political messiah who would wrestle power from the Roman authorities and restore the Davidic kingdom Jesus however, rejected the common and corrupt messianic ideas, and chose the path of a spiritual suffering servant to establish his kingdom. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>A. (i) THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TWO ROBBERS (MATT. 27: 38 &amp; 44, LUKE. 23:39-43)</p><p>i. Two robbers were crucified with Jesus, one on the right and the other on the left.</p><p>ii.

In Mark's account, one of the robbers mocked Jesus, asking, \"Are you not the Christ? save yourself and save us\".</p><p>iv. The other robber rebuked him pointing out that Jesus was innocent yet was being crucified.</p><p>v. And unlike Jesus, they deserved the punishment they were receiving.</p><p>vi.

(ii) THE ACTIVITIES OF JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA (MATT. 27:57-66, MARK 15:42- 47, LUKE 23:50-56)</p><p>i. Joseph of Arimathea was a rich and respected member of the Council/Sanhedrin.</p><p>ii. A good and righteous man/secret disciple of Christ who was after the Kingdom of God.</p><p>iii. He was aware that it was against Jewish custom to have a dead body on the cross over night.</p><p>iv. He approached Pilate and requested for the body of Christ for burial.</p><p>v. Pilate, been assured of Jesus' death, released the body.</p><p>vi. He wanted to bury Jesus because the next day was Sabbath.</p><p>vii. Joseph took the body of Christ and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud/cloth.</p><p>viii. Afterwards, he laid the body of Christ in his own new tomb, where nobody had ever been laid.</p><p>ix. He closed the entrance of the tomb with a great rock, and departed. </p><p> </p><p>B.

We should not judge others because we ourselves are sinners before God.</p><p>iv. We should always stand up for the truth irrespective of the challenges we face.</p><p>v.

After the arrival of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, Peter gave a powerful speech and about three thousand converts were made, and became part of the early church.</p><p>ii. The new converts were then baptized.</p><p>iii. Their life was characterized by a strong bond of fellowship because they were of one heart and soul.</p><p>iv. They devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings and fellowshipping together.</p><p>v. Fear came upon them as wonders and signs were performed by the apostles.</p><p>vi. Their togetherness was shown in the practice ofjoint ownership of possessions! property.</p><p>vii. They shared the proceeds among themselves according to their needs, and there was no needy person among them.</p><p>viii. Day by day, the Lord added to their number.</p><p>ix. They devoted themselves to breaking of bread from one house to another with gladness and sincerity of mind.</p><p>x. They praised God and had favour with all the people. They prayed together.</p><p>xi. The apostles gave testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and grace was upon them.</p><p>xii. Those who had land or houses sold them, and brought the money to the apostles to be shared. No one owned what he possessed.</p><p>xiii. Notable among the donors was Joseph, also known as Barnabas who willingly sold his field and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet, </p><p>xiv. However, Ananias and Sapphira his wife, were not sincere in giving out their possession and were instantly punished.</p><p>xv. Another important event which nearly marred! destroyed the unity of the Church was the unfair distribution of provisions. However, this was resolved by the appointment of the deacons. </p><p> </p><p>B. LESSONS TO BE LEARNT FROM THE LIFE OF THE EARLY CHURCH</p><p>i. Need to evangelize the word, of God</p><p>ii. Signs and wonders were very common in the early church and therefore, there is need to pray for God's presence and the power to heal.</p><p>iii. Fellowship was held in people's homes. There is no need to waste resources to build expensive churches /temples/ cathedrals</p><p>iv. The Holy Communion was frequently taken. This should be emulated.</p><p>v. The spirit of giving and taking (sharing) was in existence. We should learn to give and share.</p><p>vi. The believers did not only preach love but they also showed it. We should demonstrate our love in practical terms.</p><p>vii. Need for honesty and sincerity in the church.</p><p>viii. There was oneness and unity of purpose.

        "answer": "<p> A. JAMES' ADVICE TO CHRISTIANS ON HOW THE POOR AND THE RICH SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE CHURCH (JAMES 2:1-13)</p><p>i. James admonished Christians to show no partiality to anyone (rich or poor) but to accept others as they are equal before God.</p><p>ii. They are ambassadors of Christ and hold the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>iii. As an example, James pointed out that a man who is well dressed and the poor man in shabby clothes should be treated equally.</p><p>iv. If preferential treatment is given to the rich man over the poor man, then one is guilty of partiality.</p><p>v. Showing partiality is not only causing division but also, assuming the role of judges with evil intentions or thought.</p><p>vi. To this end, no distinction should be made among Christians, for God does not make distinctions.</p><p>vii. James further taught that God has chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to become heirs of the kingdom.</p><p>viii In showing partiality, the poor man has been dishonoured. </p><p>ix. The rich who is honoured and favoured when shown partiality is the one who oppresses the poor and drags him to court.</p><p>x, Worst still, the rich blasphemes the honourable name of God..</p><p>xi. To this end, it is imperative to fulfill the royal law which states that one should love ones' neighbour as oneself.</p><p>xii. When one commits partiality, one commits sin and is convicted by the law.</p><p>xiii. He who keeps all but one law fails in all.</p><p>xiv. To illustrate this, James said that God ordered Christians not to commit adultery and at the same time not to kill.</p><p>xv. However, breaking one of them will make one guilty of violating all aspects of the law. Both the adulterer and the murderer are transgressors.</p><p>xvi. Therefore Christians should speak and act like those cognizance of the law.</p><p>xvii. For judgment is without mercy to one who shows no mercy.</p><p>xviii. However, mercy triumphs over judgment/justice is tempered with mercy. </p><p> </p><p>B. REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST EACH OTHER</p><p>i. Discrimination brings about disunity among various groups.</p><p>ii. It does not foster sense of belonging.</p><p>iii. It encourages sycophancy, eye service and praise singing</p><p>iv. It prevents acceptance of the Gospel</p><p>v. It promotes distrust and unhealthy rivalry and mistrust/hatred.</p><p>vi. It retards progress and co-operation among people.</p><p>vii. It stifles peoples imagination/creativity/innovation! initiative</p><p>viii. It leads to under development. ix. It does not encourage equal opportunity for all.</p><p>x. It creates acrimony/conflicts.</p><p>xi. Discrimination breeds tribalism! sectionalism! nepotism.</p><p>xii. It encourages greediness and selfishness.</p><p>xiii.
