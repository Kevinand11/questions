        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the main features of the covenant between God and Abraham in Canaan.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons do we learn from the event? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) God appeared to Abram and told him to obey Him and be blameless. He would multiply him exceedingly, make him father of a multitude of nations and establish His covenant with him and his descendants. God also promised that Abram would possess the whole land of Canaan. The covenant involved the circumcision of all Abram's male children and Abram himself. It would be the great sign of the covenant for him and his descendants after him.</p><p>The circumcision was to extend to Abram's slaves and resident aliens. Any uncircumcised male should be cut off for breaking the covenant. Sarai's name was changed to Sarah and Abram's to Abraham. Sarai was to be blessed with a son. She would be the mother of many nations and kings would come from her. The promised child was to be named Isaac through whose descendants God would establish His covenant. As for Ishmael, God would bless him and multiply him as he would be father of twelve princes.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons to be learnt from the events are that:</p><p>(i) Obedience to God attracts God's blessings.</p><p>(ii) A lot of things, which look impossible to us, are possible with God (Abram and Sarah would bear a son after 100 years and 90 years, respectively).</p><p>(iii) We should believe God to fulfill His promises to us as children and descendants of Abraham.</p><p>(iv) Names have significance which affect us as individuals. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe God's intervention on behalf of Elijah.</p><p> </p><p>(b) State two lessons about the nature of God in this story.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Ahab married Jezebel, daughter of king of Sidon who brought her god (Baal) into Israel. Ahab worshipped it. Thus, Ahab provoked the anger of God more than all the kings of Israel before him. Elijah was sent by God to Ahab to denounce him and pronounce years of drought over Israel. Thereafter, God instructed Elijah to escape to the brook of Cherith where he could drink water and be fed by ravens. After a while, the brook dried up as there was no rain and God made for him an alternative arrangement as he escaped to Zarephath.</p><p>After three years of drought, Elijah was sent by God to confront Ahab and he challenged him to a contest at Mount Carmel to decide whom Israel must worship. At Mt. Carmel, Elijah ordered that two bulls be provided. Baal prophets were to choose one and prepare it for sacrifice to Baal while he too would prepare his own bull and whoever would get his sacrifices consumed by fire from his God would determine for all parties whom to serve. Baal prophets called upon their god all day to send down fire, but no fire came. Elijah taunted them to pray harder, but their god did not answer. When it came to his turn, Elijah ordered that water be poured lavishly on his own sacrifice. Despite all that, when he prayed, God answered with fire which consumed every thing, including the water. Baal prophets acknowledged Yahweh as God and Elijah ordered that all the false prophets be slain. Ahab was visibly shaken and was powerless to do any thing to harm Elijah. He rushed back home to report Elijah's victory to jezebel, his wife, who threatened to kill Elijah. God instructed Elijah to move to Horeb.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Some lessons to be learnt about the nature of God from the episode are that:</p><p>(i) God's command must be obeyed, failure to do so means punishment.</p><p>(ii) God is above all kings/rulers and their subjects.</p><p>(iii) God controls nature, e.g. rain, drought, fire, etc.</p><p>(iv) He cares for those who obey Him, e.g. Elijah.</p><p>(v) God is a jealous God, He takes vengeance on anybody who raises his hand against His anointed children.</p><p>(vi) God's servants should be prepared for trials and persecution, but victory shall be theirs at the end. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Why was a new covenant established during the time of Jeremiah?</p><p> </p><p>(b) State two consequences faced by the Israelites for breaking God's covenant</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Jeremiah had closely observed Israel's faithlessness towards their covenant with God and their apostasy in serving the useless gods of other nations. He diagnosed the fundamental reasons for their infidelity and unfaithfulness to God's covenant and attributed it to the fact that it was written in slabs of stone and thus, external. Although, the old covenant was sealed with the blood of animal, such blood was not capable of offering lasting union with God. Hence, Jeremiah introduced a new theory that unless man's soul unites with the spirit of God, no amount of verbal proclamation would produce a lasting effect. This is a new covenant because the heart of man is the only thing that can unite man with God. Under this new plan, the law would be written in people's individual hearts — unlike the old external law which was written on tablets of stone. According to Jeremiah, although God remained ever committed to His part of the covenant, Israel deviated. But if the new covenant comes from within, Jeremiah believed a lasting knowledge of God would result and God Himself would be their God.</p><p>Therefore, the need for any man to teach another to know the law would no longer be there and God would forgive their sins. He would gather His people from all the nations (from exile) and return them to Judah in safety. Henceforth, He would be their God, and they would be His people — both parties would remain faithful to each other.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The Consequences of Israelites' breaking of God's covenant were:</p><p>(i) No escape from defeat and destruction by their enemies so long as they were unfaithful.</p><p>(ii) They would be forced into exile.</p><p>(iii) Famine and drought would be their lot in their homeland.</p><p>(iv) They would suffer national disgrace.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) For the second time, God directed Jonah to go to Nineveh and proclaim God's punishment for their wickedness. He went and declared to them that they had only forty days and Nineveh would be overthrown for their wickedness had come before God. The people believed him and proclaimed a fast. They put on sack cloth and sent words to the king. The king also put on sack cloth and sat in ashes. He declared fasting for both men and beasts for the people to cry to God for forgiveness and abandon their evil ways so as to make God repent and not bring destruction to the people</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons which can be learnt from the above are:</p><p>(i) God saw the genuineness of their repentance and forgave them.</p><p>(ii) God's providence is universal, even non Israelites who turn to Him in repentance would receive God's mercy and forgiveness.</p><p>(iii) It is futile to disobey God as it may lead to severe punishment or eternal death.</p><p>(iv) Fasting and prayer may make God to forgive men of their sin. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)According to St. Luke's account, Angel Gabriel visited the virgin, Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph in Nazareth. The angel hailed (greeted) Mary as the favoured one and told her that the Lord was with her. Mary was troubled in mind because she did not quite understand that manner of greeting. The angel asked her not to be afraid, but told her that she would conceive in her womb and bear a son to be called Jesus — The son of the Most High. The Lord God would give him the throne of David and he would reign forever. Mary asked the angel how it would happen for she had no husband. The angel told her that the Holy Spirit would come upon her and the power of the most High would overshadow her, hence the child would be called Holy, the son of God. He confirmed to Mary that her cousin, Elizabeth had also conceived a son in her old age. She was then six months' pregnant. Though she had been barren before then, with God, nothing was impossible. Mary said that she was God's handmaid and wished the angel's words be fulfilled as prophesied.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The Luke account differs from that of Matthew in some ways:</p><p>(i) In Matthew, an angel did not visit Mary, it was Joseph who saw an angel in a dream. The angel is not named.</p><p>(ii) Matthew alone mentions Joseph's earlier intent to divorce Mary when she was found to be pregnant. There was no such information in Luke's account.</p><p>(iii) Angel Gabriel spoke to Mary in St. Luke and she obeyed the word of God with faith.</p><p>(iv) In Matthew, there was no reference to Elizabeth as in Luke.</p>",

There appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus about his departure. Peter and the other disciples were heavy with sleep though awake enough to see his glory and the two persons. Peter said, \"Lord it is well that we are here, let us build three booths, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" As he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them and they were afraid.</p><p>A voice was heard which said,\"This is my beloved son with whom I am pleased, listen to him.\" The disciples fell on their faces. Jesus asked them to rise, and not to fear. Jesus commanded them to tell no one what they had seen until the son of man was raised from the dead. They asked him why the scribes said that Elijah must first come to restore all things. Jesus told them that Elijah had already come, but they did not know him and so they did to him whatever they pleased. In the same way, he said, the son of man would suffer in their hands. The disciples understood that he was referring to John the Baptist. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The resurrection story of Jesus Christ in St. Matthew's gospel holds that early in the morning, on the day after the Sabbath (Sunday), Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James went to the tomb. There, an angel told them that Jesus had risen and that the disciples should go to Galilee to meet him there. As they went to see the other disciples, Jesus met them and said: \"Hail\". They took hold of his feet and worshipped him. Jesus told them not to fear but to go and tell the other disciples to meet him in Galilee. When some of the, guards discovered that Christ had actually risen and had gone out of the grave, they went into the city and told the chief priests what had happened.</p><p>They conspired with the elders and bribed the soldiers with money to say, \"his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were sleeping.\" The soldiers were assured that if it came to the governor's knowledge, they would satisfy him and keep them out of trouble. So, they took the money and did as they were directed. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The eleven disciples went to Galilee where they met Jesus, although some doubted. Jesus told them that all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to him. He commanded them to \"go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and I am with you always, to the close of the age\". </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) When the apostles were re-arrested and brought to the Council, the high priest questioned them on why they continued to teach in Jesus' name, inspite of warning not to do so. Peter and the apostles replied, \"we must obey God rather than men.\" The Council was thus enraged and wanted to kill them, but for Gamaliel who requested that the apostles be sent outside and then advised them to take care of what they do to the apostles. He cited the case of Theudas who earlier had four hundred followers, but, when he was slain, his followers dispersed and the sect came to nothing. After him arose Judas of Galilee in the days of the census who also perished and his followers scattered. So in the present case, \"keep away from these men. If this undertaking is of men, they will fail, but, if it is of God you cannot over throw them. You might even be found opposing God\". The Council heeded his advice, although they beat and charged the disciples not to preach in the name of Jesus again.</p><p> </p><p>(b) From Gamaliel's wise counsel, these qualities can be said of him:</p><p>(i) Gamaliel was a man of courage. He did not display any fear in his effort to protect the apostles.</p><p>(ii) He proved himself an educated man with a good knowledge of history.</p><p>(iii) He was a godly man who did not believe in wickedness and did not want the murder of the innocent apostles.</p><p>(iv) He was a man of peace as he abhorred any form of conflict in the society.</p><p>(v) He was tolerant and allowed the exercise of individual conviction.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Paul proved that Christians are children of God as he taught that with the advent of faith, Christians are no longer under any dispensation of law. We are sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. Our baptism means putting on Christ. In Christ Jesus, there is no discrimination, no Jew nor Greek. If we are Christ's, then we are Abraham's offspring and heirs according to promise. The heir can be compared to a slave because though he owns the estate, he could not exercise control being under a guardian. So when we were children, we were slaves to the spiritual elements, but at the appointed time, God sent His son who was born of a woman and even under the law to redeem those who were under the law, thus enabling them to receive adoption as sons leading to freedom through Christ. When we become sons of God, we receive the spirit of His son in our hearts and by so doing we are no longer slaves but sons of God and, therefore, heirs. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Explain Paul's teaching on resurrection.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Give two reasons why the resurrection of Jesus is of great significance to Christians.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul reminded the Corinthians about the central core of his apostolic teachings and the basis of their faith in the resurrection of Jesus and the assurance of salvation. He taught them what he himself received and believed, i.e. according to the scriptures, Jesus died because of man's sin. He was buried and he rose from the dead on the third day and appeared to Cephas (Simon Peter). He also appeared to the older apostles and many others and lastly, Paul himself who was the worst persecutor of the church and unfit to be called an apostle. Therefore, he had to work harder than the rest of the apostles to ensure that the truth which he had received was passed on to the Corinthians. Since he and the others had preached that Jesus rose from the dead, how dare some people say that there is no resurrection. It. therefore, follows that if Christ had not risen, then their preaching was baseless and their faith would be in vain. The preachers would be guilty of misrepresenting God since they had testified that God raised Christ from the dead. If Christ had not been raised, then they would remain in sin and those who had fallen asleep or died in Christ would perish. Therefore, if it was for this earthly life they had lived a Christ-like life, they were to be pitied as the most miserable of men.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The resurrection of Jesus Christ is significant as follows:</p><p>(i) Christians believe that with Jesus Christ's resurrection. Christians are also by faith to rise from the dead and join Christ at his second coming.</p><p>(ii) As Christ rose and ascended into glory, the same glory awaits Christians since Christ as the second Adam is a life-giving spirit.</p><p>(iii) By his resurrection. Christ has won victory over principalities and powers, Satan, sin and death. Therefore, death will have no more dominion over believers.</p><p>(iv) The resurrection frees Christians from the curse of the law and sin</p><p>(v) No resurrection, no Christianity.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Explain the concept of 'Giving' as outlined in Paul's second letter to the Corinthians.</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways can a Christian provide relief for the suffering of others?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul commended the Corinthians for their readiness to contribute to support the saints in Jerusalem. Following their contributions, he boasted to the Macedonians that the Corinthians had been ready with their relief materials since the previous year. Their action motivated some of the Macedonians to act accordingly. Paul, therefore, sent ahead of his arrival some people to ensure that their gifts were made ready for dispatch in order not to be embarrassed or humiliated with his boasting. He told them that whoever sowed sparingly would also reap sparingly, while those who sowed generously would also reap generously.</p><p>Therefore, they should individually contribute willingly, (not under compulsion) what each had originally proposed in his mind, for God loves a cheerful giver. God is always ready to release to cheerful givers His blessings in abundance so that they may have enough of everything for their own sustenance and more to spare for others and the poor. God who supplies seed to the sowers and bread for food will supply and multiply their resources, thus increasing the harvest of their righteousness.</p><p>By so doing, they will receive unlimited enrichment and blessing from God for their good works, enrich the saints physically and multiply their thankfulness to God. It is, therefore, a test of their Christian life and the acceptance of the gospel of Christ which will reflect God's glory. And, as for the saints, i.e, the recipients, their prayers for the Corinthians would be boundless. In conclusion, Paul gave thanks to God for His gift of Jesus which is beyond human experience and a demonstration of God's supreme example of giving to all.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Some ways by which a Christian can provide relief for the suffering of others include:</p><p>(i) collecting cloths as charity to old peoples Homes, Charity Homes, etc.</p><p>(ii) sale/purchase of Red Cross poppies for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, families of fallen soldiers, etc.</p><p>(iii) collecting money through projects such as bob-a-job exercises to provide toys, little sweaters, baby dresses for motherless babies in Charity Homes.</p><p>(iv) sponsorship of the course of the poor by well-to-do Christians.</p><p>(v) Setting up special funds for the needy in the society. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Peter exhorts Christians to rejoice in the hope of the glory which awaits them owing to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Although in this present life, their joy might be limited by the trials and persecutions that would come their way such trials and persecutions are meant to prove the genuineness of their faith and make them to reap the rich reward a salvation when Jesus is revealed. In order to fully realize the hope of salvation, Christians should live holy lives in the full knowledge that God, the impartial judge would take note of their sufferings on the day of judgement. Furthermore, they should not forget that Jesus himself passed through greater suffering. If they were reproached for the name of Christ, they should count themselves blessed. They should, however, not suffer as murderers, thieves, or for any wrong doing but if they suffer for Christ, they should not be ashamed. They should instead, glorify God for on that day, judgement would begin with those who call upon the name of God and the fate of the unbelievers might be terrible.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Some of the virtues for a Christian to manifest inspite of trials are:</p><p>(i) They should not conform to the carnal desires of men of the world.</p><p>(ii) They should remain sober and hopeful of the glory and salvation that would be theirs when Jesus would be revealed (at his Parousia).</p><p>(iii) The fear of God should be their watchword because God is an impartial judge.</p><p>(iv) They should remain for ever in their Christian faith, unshaken by any wind of persecution, the affliction of the enemy or Satan, the devil.</p><p>(v) They should always praise God both in time of sadness and joy. </p>",
