        "question": "<p>(a) How did Moses prepare the Israelites for the covenant with God?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Why was this preparation necessary?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) In the Wilderness of Sin, the people of Israel encamped at the mountain as instructed by God. Moses went up the mountain to hear what God had to tell him. He was to address the people so that they would appreciate what God did for them when they were in Egypt, especially how He bore them on eagle's wings. They should obey God and keep His laws. God said that they shall be His own possession, they shall be a holy nation. Moses delivered God's message to the people. They promised to obey all that the Lord had spoken to them as delivered by Moses. Moses went back to God and reported the people's response. The Lord said he would return to them in a thick cloud so that they might hear Him speak to Moses and believe that it was Him that spoke. God instructed Moses to go and consecrate them. He also warned that there must be a distance between the people and God for anybody who goes near the Lord would be destroyed.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The preparation became necessary because</p><p>(i) God is holy.</p><p>(ii) No body should disobey Him; any disobedience would be punished by God.</p><p>(iii) Due to the holiness of God, whoever approaches the mountain to hear God must himself be holy. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Who was Naaman? Narrate the story of Naaman.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention two important lessons which Naaman learnt from his healing</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Naaman was a commander of the Syrian army. He was leprous. He tried everything he could to heal his leprosy, but there was no solution. An Israelite slave girl in the service of Naaman's wife suggested that if Naaman could go to Samaria, there was a prophet there who could heal his leprosy. Naaman took to the girl's advice and collected a letter from the king of Syria to the king of Israel informing him of Naaman's predicament. The king of Israel was sad when he received and read the letter. He queried whether he was God to kill or make alive that a word was sent to him that Naaman should be cured by him of his leprosy. Elisha, the prophet of God then in Israel learnt that the king had rent his clothes. He sent to the king that Naaman should be sent to him. Naaman went to Elisha who instead of praying for him or laying his hands on him directed that Naaman should go and wash himself seven times in the River Jordan and he would be cured of his leprosy. Naaman doubted, and wondered if Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus were not better than all the waters of Israel. Could he not wash in them and be cleaned? He decided to return to Damascus with great annoyance and disappointment, but his servant persuaded him to do what the man of God had commanded. He yielded to the advice of his servant, and went into the river Jordan. He dipped himself into it seven times and he became so clean that his skin, according to the bible, became fresh as of a new born baby. Seeing this, Naaman returned to Elisha with some precious gifts to present to him as gratitude and sign of thanksgiving, but Elisha rejected them. Naaman requested that he should be allowed to collect a small quantity of earth from Israel to Damascus. His request was granted. He put the sand in a corner of his house and said henceforth, he would serve the God of Israel.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons learnt by Naaman from his healing were:</p><p>(i) He became convinced that the God of Israel was the only true God.</p><p>(ii) He learnt that prophets of Israel had power to perform healing miracles.</p><p>(iii) He learnt that God is a forgiving God.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>When social injustices and religious malpractices of Israel had reached its peak, Amos condemned the social and religious immoralities among the people. The priest of the royal sanctuary at Bethel, Amaziah reported Amos to the king accusing him of conspiracy and sedition. Amos was then ordered to go back to Judah where he belonged, to prophesy and earn his living there. He was warned never to prophesy in Israel again because it was a royal sanctuary. Amos replied Amaziah that it was when he (Amos) was tending the flock that the Lord sent him to prophesy to Israel.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since Amaziah stood against his prophecy, he pronounced the following curses on him:</p><p>(a) Amaziah's wife would become a harlot in the city.</p><p>(b) His sons and daughter would be slained by the sword.</p><p>(c) His land would be divided by line.</p><p>(d) Israel would surely go into exile, away from its land.</p>",

Jesus asked John to baptize him so as to fulfil all righteousness. John consented and Jesus was baptised. As he came out of the water, the heavens were opened and the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove and a voice came from heaven saying: \"This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased\".</p><p>Jesus' baptism was important in the following ways:</p><p>(i) The baptism marked Jesus' call to public ministry as a God-sent Messiah.</p><p>(ii) Jesus accepted baptism by immersion in order to give his approval to the Jewish ritual of a symbolic cleansing of sin.</p><p>(iii) Jesus did not sin, yet he wanted others to be free from sin.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What was Jesus' teaching about himself as the Living Bread?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways is this teaching significant ? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) When the multitude that came to Jesus had been fed, he left for the other side of the sea. People sought for him and went to him on a boat. Jesus said that they were looking for him in order to be fed not because of the signs they had seen. He enjoined them to seek for the word of life which leads to eternal life. Such food, he said, could only come from the son of man who has the power to give.</p><p>The people asked him what they would do as proof that they were doing the work of God. Jesus told them to believe in him, who was sent by God. They requested for a sign to make them believe that truly he was sent by God. They went further that their forefathers ate manna in the wilderness which was sent down from heaven. Jesus said that manna was sent as a temporary relief from physical hunger, but God has sent down a living bread which gives life to the world. The people then demanded for the bread of life which he said anyone who eat would no longer be hungry. Yet, they did not believe Jesus despite the fact that they had seen him. He said that none of those that has been given by his father would be cast out and that he has come from heaven to do God's will.</p><p> </p><p>(b) This teaching is significant in the following ways:</p><p>(I) Living bread signifies the word of God.</p><p>(ii) Faith in Jesus is a sure way to everlasting life.</p><p>(iii) Works without faith in Jesus is useless. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Those who formed the nucleus of the church in Antioch were teachers of importance and honour. Among them were Paul and Simeon Lucius. As they were worshipping and giving thanks to God, the Holy spirit directed that Paul and Barnabas should be set apart for the work which He (God) had appointed to them. After the apostles had prayed and fasted, they laid hands on them and sent them off. They travelled down to Selucia and from there, they went to Cyprus.</p><p>They preached to the people of Salamis in the Jewish synagogue when they got there. From Salamis, they went down to the Island. On the Island, they went to the residence of the proconsul named Sergius Paulus who gave them invitation so that he might hear the word of God. There, they met a Jewish false magician named Bar-Jesus who opposed their preaching. He did not want the Jewish officials in the Synagogue to listen to the word of God which Paul and Barnabas wanted to preach.</p><p>However, Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit looked at him and described him as an enemy of all righteousness who wanted to stop and make crooked the straight paths of the Lord. In the course of this, Bar-Jesus was cursed and immediately, he became blind. He sought for the help of people to lead him about. When the proconsul saw what happened, he believed in the teaching of Paul and Barnabas. From Paphos, Paul and Barnabas sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. </p>",

        "question": "<p>From Paul's letter to the Romans, explain the term Justification and state the conditions for its achievement. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Justification can be explained as a process of being acquitted from sin by God. It is a process by which man's sin is forgiven and over-looked by God as a saving grace for eternal life. The conditions for the achievement of justification can be stated as follows: Justification is a gift of God's grace. It cannot be attained by man's effort or his perfection. It was the wish of Jesus to carry man's sin on the cross, therefore, man has the choice of rejecting it, but the consequence of rejection is destruction.</p><p>A Christian, therefore, has to believe in the resurrection of Jesus as a first step to justification. It is the confession of a man's faith with his mouth that can earn him salvation. Those who are trusting in the righteousness of the law (Jews and Gentiles) have fallen short of the Grace of God. Those who would be accepted by Jesus when he comes back are those who accept him in faith.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Peter preached and advised young Christians to be respectful to the elders; to clothe themselves with humility because God resists and hates the proud, but honours and exalts the humble in a matter of time. He cautioned them not to give chance to anxiety, for God knows their needs. They must be on the look out for the devil who is the enemy of all Christians and who prowls around like a lion, looking for those whom he will deceive to join its acursed band. Therefore, the devil must be resisted at all cost, with strong faith in Jesus. Part of Christians' heritage is temptation. Therefore, eternal glory in Christ awaits the Christians who resist and overcome.</p><p> </p><p>(b) There are many situations today which call for humility among Christians. These include:</p><p>(i) Opposition by agents of the devil or other faith.</p><p>(ii) Civic responsibility and obligations e.g. paying taxes, upholding family sanctity, frowning at examination malpractices.</p><p>(iii) Opposition by the non-faithful. </p>",
