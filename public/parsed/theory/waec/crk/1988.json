        "question": "<p>Narrate the first creation story in Genesis and explain how God established His sovereignty over His creation. </p>",
        "answer": "<p> In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. The earth was without any form and was void. Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, \"let there be light\" and there was light. The light was good and God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light day and the darkness He called night. On the second day, God created the firmament in the midst of the waters. On the third day, He ordered the dry land to appear and it did. God called the dry land earth and the waters He called sea. God commanded the earth to bring forth grass, trees and its fruits. On the fourth day, God made the sun, the moon and the stars. So also on the fifth day, God created all the living creatures. He created the fish of the sea and other living creatures living therein; birds of the air and their kinds and God saw that they were good. He commanded them to multiply in the sea and on the land. God created animals of various kinds on the sixth day. The same day, He created man in His own image. In the image of God, created He him. God commanded man to be fruitful and multiply. On the seventh day God rested.</p><p> </p><p>God established His Sovereignty over His Creation in the following ways:</p><p>(i) God has total power and control over all the things He had created.</p><p>(ii) We can learn from the creation activities that all the things God created came through the words of mouth\", let there be\".</p><p>(iii) It equally shows that God is the controller of the universe.</p><p>(iv) It also shows that God is a law maker for all the creatures He had made in the entire universe. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Give an account of the religious persecution suffered by Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and comment on any point of significance about it. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>During the reign of king Nebuchadnezzar, he made an image and set it up on the plains of Dura for all his officials to pay homage to and worship.To this end, he issued a decree that whoever refused to bow down to the image after hearing the sound of a particular music would be thrown into the furnace of burning fire. All the officers in his domain gathered together waiting for the sound of the music. At the hearing of the music all the officers bowed down and worshipped the image. But there were three Jewish high ranking officers namely Shadrach, Meshack and Abednego who refused to bow down and worship the image. They were reported to king Nebuchadnezzar. They were warned in the presence of the king that if they failed to obey the decree, they would be thrown into a burning furnace. They replied that their faith was in God and in His power. They said that God of Israel would deliver them from the furnace. They told the king that they were prepared to be thrown into the burning furnace instead of bowing down to the image.</p><p>Following this, the king ordered that the furnace be heated seven times more. The three men were thrown into the furnace. Even the men that threw them into the furnace died due to the great heat from the furnace. To the king's surprise, he saw four men as against three that were cast into the fire. The fourth man resembled the son of God. The king came closer to the fire and called out to the three men. They answered him. Nebuchadnezzar then praised the God of the Hebrews when he discovered that the men were not hurt despite the great heat of the burning furnace. As a result of this, the three men were promoted and the king issued another decree instantly that no one should speak against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.</p><p> </p><p>The significance of the religious persecution suffered by the three Hebrew men - Shadrach, Meshack and Abednego can be explained as follows:</p><p>(i) The unshaken trust, faith and confidence of the three men in the God they served were demonstrated.</p><p>(ii) It can also be pointed out that the men had courage by their action.</p><p>(iii) They did not doubt in their belief that God would deliver them from king Nebuchadnezzar.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How did Jonah react to God's message ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons do we learn about the nature of God from this episode? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The people of Nineveh had sinned against God. Because of this, Jonah received a message from God to go to the city and preach to them. Jonah did not want to go. Instead, he boarded a ship going from Joppa to Tarshish in order to avoid the mission he was sent by God. God caused a great wind upon the sea which threatened to break up the ship. The crew men threw all their luggage away into the sea to lighten the ship and also offered prayers to their gods but to no avail. By this time, Jonah was fast asleep in the inner part of the ship. When he was discovered from where he was sleeping, they asked him to join his fellow passengers in prayer. They cast lots which revealed Jonah as being responsible for their problem. Jonah narrated his mission to them and told them to throw him into the sea as that was the only solution to the problem. The captain of the ship could not do otherwise. They threw him into the sea. When that was done, the storm stopped instantly and the sailors offered a sacrifice to God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two Lessons to be learnt from the story of Jonah and the raging sea are:</p><p>(i) God created man and all other things and has authority over them. Therefore, He expects every of His creation to obey Him and do His will.</p><p>(ii) There is no way one can run away or hide from God without God fishing such a man out because He is Omnipresent (every where) and Omniscient (all knowing). </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What does Jesus teach in the sermon on the mount about? (i) Almsgiving (ii) Prayer (iii) Fasting.</p><p> </p><p>(b) How has the Christian Church in Nigeria adhered to these teachings?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) In His sermon on the mount, Jesus warned and charged religious leaders not to seek praises from men. This is what the Jewish religious leaders did in order that they might be praised publicly. Jesus drew some biblical teachings from the following:</p><p>(i) ALMSGIVING: According to Jesus, when we give alms, it should not be made known to the public in order not to attract the praises of men. When you give gifts in secret, God who sees in secret will reward and bless you accordingly. It is then that you can be adequately rewarded by God who sees in secret.</p><p>(ii) PRAYER: When we pray, everything that could attract people or public attention should be avoided. We should direct our prayers with all respect to God our father. We should base our hope on the will of God to be done in the world; afterwards, we ask God for necessities of life and the power to overcome sin. An example of this kind of prayer was rendered in our Lord's prayer - \"Our father \"</p><p>(iii) FASTING: Jesus gave his disciples some instructions regarding fasting, to the effect that, when we fast, we should not disfigure our outlook to the public to show that we are fasting, nor should we allow ourselves to be praised by people for this purpose. Instead, we should anoint our heads and wash our faces so that our fasting may be known to God alone who will also answer our prayers.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Today, many Christian churches in Nigeria follow these teachings with regard to almsgiving, prayers and fasting. Yet, there are certain groups, especially the modern day Pentecostal churches, who, when praying, will shout in public places so that they may be heard. They organise carnivals and revivals in street corners to attract others who do not belong to their groups to show that they know how to pray better. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How does John portray Jesus as the True Vine?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons do we derive from the relationship between Christ and His believers?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) According to St. John's gospel, Jesus describes himself as the true vine and his father as the vine dresser. Any branch that does not bear fruit will be cut off. He stated that his disciples should abide in him and his words will abide in them. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, so this kind of relationship should also exist between Jesus and his disciples. It is when there is cordial relationship between Jesus and his disciples that they can achieve something. He goes further that if they abide in him and his words abide in them, then, they should ask whatever they like and it shall be done to them.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two Lessons to be learnt from the relationship between Christ and His disciples are:</p><p>(i) When the followers of Christ abide in him, they will bear much fruit and God will glorify them.</p><p>(ii) The joy of living is complete when we have our being in Jesus Christ. For this reason we will become a fountain of living waters and then, everlasting life will be ours in the world to come. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What social problem brought about the appointment of the deacons in the early church?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention five social problems facing the church today.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) There were many problems that were brought about as a result of the neglect of the Hellenists who murmured against the Jews for not allowing them to participate in the daily distribution of food. This problem nearly shook the foundation of the early church until the apostles found a lasting solution to it. The apostles said that it would not be possible for them to-supervise the sharing of the food and at the same time, administer the gospel. They, therefore, said that the church should appoint men of high repute, full of the holy spirit and wisdom to take the responsibility of sharing the daily food. This suggestion was accepted by the church and seven men were selected and presented before the apostle.They prayed and laid hands on them. Prominent among the men selected was the first martyr, Stephen.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The five social problems facing the church today are:</p><p>(i) There is no unity among the leaders of the present day churches. They are after one another. </p><p>(ii) There is equally the problem of polygamy.</p><p>(iii) Proliferation of churches and doctrines often cause confusion among members.</p><p>(iv) Love of material gain, stealing the church money and of course modern civilization is also militating against the modern day church.</p><p>(v) Local customs which are interfering with the Christian practices is another problem. </p>",

        "question": "<p>What are the attributes of and rewards for humility as stated in the Epistles?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>In his letter to the Philippians, Paul exhorts the Philippians to imitate Christ who, not counting His divinity, willingly condescended to take on human form in order to save us. Paul advises the followers of Christ to copy Jesus in their service to God and humanity. To St. Peter, he sees humility as the opposite of pride which leads to the ultimate fall of satan. Peter encourages children of God to put on humility as an Armour of defence against the temptation of the devil.</p><p> </p><p>The attributes of Humility as stated in the epistle include:</p><p>(i) Respect for elders and constituted authority.</p><p>(ii) Rendering selfless services to mankind.</p><p>(iii) Living a life free from anxiety while leaving everything to God for our good.</p><p>(iv) Because of Jesus' humility, God exalted him both in heaven and on earth.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Discuss Paul's teaching on civic responsibility and show how we can apply three of the instances in our daily living.</p>",
        "answer": "<p> In his writings to the Romans, Paul deals with how Christians should perform their civic responsibility. He taught that Christians should not fail to render useful services to their community despite different views on religious ideologies. He (Paul) writes that everybody should be obedient to the laws of the state. To do this perfectly, Christians should discharge their civic responsibilities like paying their taxes, rates and any other levy charged for the progress and development of the community. Christians, as children of God, should obey and respect constituted authorities, as this I amounts to obeying God Himself. Christians should not engage in open confrontation with the government. An example of this, which Paul gave was the revolt of the Jews against Roman government which led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.</p><p> </p><p>Paul's teachings on civic responsibility can be applied in our daily life as follows:</p><p>(i) We should be self disciplined, obedient to leaders and reliable in our daily dealings with others.</p><p>(ii) The youth must be actively mobilized through youth organizations in order to be taught Christian ethics and morals.</p><p>(iii) We should live a productive life. We should not rely on others for our daily needs. Children of God must do away with things that are anti-social like drugs and must not be lazy.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How did Paul reconcile Onesimus with Philemon ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What can we learn about forgiveness from this letter? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Onesimus was a slave to Philemon but proved useless as against the meaning of his name which is \"profitable one\". Philemon was a Colossian christian who was converted by Paul. Onesimus had escaped with Philemon's property to Rome where he met Paul - a' prisoner of Christ. Paul converted Onesimus and pleaded with Philemon in writing, to accept him back. Paul, in the letter told Philemon how useful Onesimus had been to him. He had a great belief in Philemon that he would forgive Onesimus.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons which can be drawn from Paul's letter to Philemon include:</p><p>(i) An act of forgiveness should go beyond the mere action of forgiving but should include rehabilitation and reconciliation.</p><p>(ii) It teaches the lesson of justification by faith in which man who stands condemned before God because of sin, is automatically forgiven and acquitted of his sins through the redeeming blood of Jesus Christ.</p><p>(iii) As Christians, we should intercede for others as Paul did for Onesimus.</p>",
