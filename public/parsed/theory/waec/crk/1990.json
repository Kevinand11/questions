        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the crossing of the Red sea and God's role in the episode.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons did Israel learn from their experience there? </p>",
        "answer": "<p> (a) After the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, Pharaoh regretted his action to have allowed them to leave. He re-grouped his soldiers to pursue the Israelites. The Isrealites encamped at Pihahiroth where they were overtaken by the Egyptian soldiers who rode on horses and chariots. When the Israelites saw them, they were afraid and they cried to the Lord for their safety. They said that it would have been better for them to die in the land of Egypt than to die in the wilderness.</p><p>Moses strengthened their faith by telling them not to entertain any fear, but to stand firm, for the Lord was with them and would fight for them. \" The Egyptians you see today will not be seen again tomorrow\", Moses assured his people. He cried to the Lord and he was told to stretch his rod over the sea. The Lord blocked the view and slowed down the movement of the Egyptians by the pillar of cloud which led the Israelites behind them. Moses did as the Lord had commanded him. He stretched his rod over the sea.</p><p>A great wind drove back the waters. The people of Israel crossed the sea on dry land. The Egyptians gave the Israelites a hot chase, but the wheel of their chariots could not move. Moses immediately followed the order of God and stretched his rod over the sea and the water returned. The Egyptian soldiers, their horses and chariots, who were already in the middle of the sea were all drowned and they perished. This is how God was victorious over Pharaoh and his army.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lesson learnt by the Israelites from their Red sea experiences are:</p><p>(I) The Israelites learnt that it is good to have faith in the Lord.</p><p>(ii) They equally learnt that God is ready to protect His people in the period of need.</p><p>(iii) They also learnt that God was very loyal, faithful and kept His promises to His people.</p><p>(iv) They also learnt that God punished those who disobey Him and humbled the proud.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Narrate the story of Naaman and Gehazi and state the consequences of greed</p>",
        "answer": "<p> Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army was leprous and there was no one to cure him. An Israelite maid of Naaman revealed to his wife that there was a prophet in Israel who could heal his leprosy if Naaman could be taken there. The Syrian king got wind of the story and sent Naaman to Israel with a letter for immediate cure. This message frightened the king of Israel who asked whether he was God that heals. He suspected that it was a diplomatic way for the king of Syria to invade his domain. Elisha, the prophet learnt of this and requested that Naaman be sent to him. Instead of the prophet to pray for Naaman, he sent a messenger to tell him to go and wash seven times in River Jordan.</p><p>Angered by this action of Elisha, Naaman queried whether Syrian rivers were not better than River Jordan. He then decided to turn back to go home, but his servant reminded him about the importance of the assignment and that what he was asked to do was simple. Naaman yielded to the advice of his servant. He dipped himself in river Jordan seven times as recommended and his leprosy was healed.</p><p>To show his gratitude to God, Naaman offered some gifts to Elisha, but it was rejected by the prophet. Naaman then requested to be allowed to carry some earth from Israel to Syria. Following this miraculous action, Naaman decided to worship the God of Isreal. Naaman departed with his gifts but Gehazi, Elisha's servant went and met him and lied that his master had sent him to demand for some of the gifts and he was given. Elisha saw what his servant did but when Gehazi was asked, he lied to his master.</p><p> </p><p>The consequences of Gehazi's greed include:</p><p>(i) Gehazi's sin was revealed.</p><p>(ii) Elisha cursed him and his family.</p><p>(iii) He was dismissed from the service of his master and kept off from the society.</p><p>(iv) Naaman's leprosy was transferred to Gehazi</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Nehemiah, a captive in Babylon was visited by Hanai. Nehemiah wanted to know the state of Jerusalem and her inhabitants. Nehemiah was told that the remnants of the land were in great trouble and shame. He was told that the gates and the walls were broken down and destroyed. This made Nehemiah sad and he wept bitterly. He then fasted and prayed for several days. He requested for his freedom from the king of Babylon. He was allowed to go. On his arrival in Jerusalem, he delivered the king's letters to the governors of the provinces. In the letters, it was written that the materials needed by Nehemiah for the reconstruction of the city be supplied to him. This was done and the reconstruction work on the walls of Jerusalem began in earnest. Nehemiah went in the night to inspect the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down. Nehemiah said: \" Let us build the walls of Jerusalem so that we may no longer suffer disgrace\". The people responded and the work started, but, Samballat and. Tobiah opposed the reconstruction work.</p><p> </p><p>(b) From Nehemiah's role in the reconstruction of the city wall, we have the following lessons to learn:</p><p>(i) Nehemiah showed a spirit of love for his nation.</p><p>(ii) Nehemiah motivated his people into action.</p><p>(iii) Nehemiah's faith in God was demonstrated through prayer.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Narrate the parable of the rich man and Lazarus and indicate two lessons that could be learnt from it. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>There was a rich man who was always gorgeously dressed. He lived in a big and beautiful house. At his gate was a poor man named Lazarus who wore rags and had sores all over his body. He begged even to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, but he was daily ignored. The dogs came and licked his wounds. When both men died, Lazarus was carried to Abraham's bosom while the rich man was carried to Hades or hell where he was in great agony. He saw Abraham afar and Lazarus in his bosom. He cried, \" Father Abraham, have mercy upon me and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame\". Abraham replied: \" Son, remember that you in your life time received your good things and Lazarus in like manner evil things, but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish\".</p><p>He was further told that there was a gulf between heaven and hell for either of them to cross over. The rich man requested Father Abraham to send Lazarus to his brothers on earth to tell them to be kind to the-poor. Abraham told him that his brothers had Moses and the prophets whom they should listen to. The rich man pressed further that if only someone from the dead would preach to them, they would listen. In his reply, Abraham said that if they could not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither would they listen if someone should rise from the dead.</p><p> </p><p>Lessons which can be learnt from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus are:</p><p>(i) The parable teaches concern for one another.</p><p>(ii) As the Jews rejected the teaching of Moses and the prophets, so also did they reject the son of God, Jesus who was sent to bring salvation to mankind.</p><p>(iii) If we misuse our opportunities on earth, it may be taken away from us when we get to heaven.</p><p>(iv) Over-indulgence of the physical appetite leaves no room for spiritual growth.</p>",

When the wine they had finished, Jesus' mother called his attention to it, but Jesus replied: \" 0 woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come\". However, Jesus told them to fill the six empty jars that were there with water. Mary then told the servants to do whatever Jesus asked them to do. Jesus told them to draw the water to the steward of the feast. The steward tasted the water which had turned into wine. The steward questioned the bridegroom why he had kept the good wine only to bring it after the people had been drunk with the sour wine.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The Miracle had the following lessons to teach</p><p>(I) The glory of Jesus was revealed and his disciples believed in him.</p><p>(ii) Jesus is ready at anytime to help those in need.</p><p>(iii) Jesus had respect for his parents.</p><p>(iv) Jesus is ready to save people in distress or danger</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a)  How did God use Gamaliel to further the cause of Christianity in the early church ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention any four types of opposition that are confronting the Christian church today. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The apostles were re-arrested and imprisoned. Ever before this time, the Sadduces had been opposed to the teachings of Jesus Christ. They did not believe in resurrection after death which Jesus Christ preached. As his apostles continued after Jesus' death, the Sadducees and others who opposed Jesus' teaching and his wonders were not happy. In the night, an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and set them free.</p><p>The Sanhedrin were surprised when they learnt that they were no longer in the prison. Instead, they were found in the temple, teaching the people. Without any violence, they were brought back before the council for their trial. The high priest said: \" We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us\". The apostles replied; \"We must obey God rather than men...\" The apostles accused the Jews of killing Jesus whom God raised. When the Sanhedrin heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. But Gamaliel, a pharisee and a popular teacher of the law intervened on behalf of the apostles. He cautioned the council members and prevailed on them not to kill the apostles, saying that if this plan is of men, it would fail; but if it is of God, they would not be able to overthrow the apostles. Gamaliel's advice was taken. The apostles were released after some flogging and warning that they should stop preaching in the name of Jesus.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Different types of oppositions confronting the church today include:</p><p>(i) In some parts of the country and even in some schools, Christians are not allowed to preach publicly.</p><p>(ii) Also, church buildings are not allowed in some parts of the country.</p><p>(iii) Christians suffer open persecution, thereby leading to wanton destruction of lives and property.</p><p>(iv) There is discrimination against Christians in employment opportunities and promotions in public service.</p><p>(v) Christians are discriminated against in marriages and funeral ceremonies.</p><p>(vi) Christians are denied the freedom of worship and religious holidays</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How does Paul use the case of Abraham to prove justification by faith?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What role does faith play in the life of christians today?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) In Paul's teaching, he said that since no man could claim perfection, he could not be justified by acts of the law, but only by faith in Jesus Christ. Abraham was righteous not by the law, but by act of his faith in God's promise. Those who believe in salvation through obedience to the law have no claim to faith. Those who believe in God's promise through faith as Abraham did are heirs of God's kingdom. Law brings punishment because it leads to the knowledge of sin and transgression. Faith is based on grace, love and peace. Though Abraham was 100 years and his wife Sarah 90, yet they had faith in God's promise of a child. And God gave unto them Isaac</p><p> </p><p>(b) The role of faith in the life of Christians today include:</p><p>(i) Faith assures Christians of eternal salvation.</p><p>(ii) It shows that Christians are no longer under the bond of law but under the grace.</p><p>(iii) It is by faith that Christians face the challenges of life with enough courage and confidence.</p><p>(iv) Faith is a motivator of Christians for good works, e.g. education, medicine, evangelization, etc. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How according to Paul could a christian rightly become a child of God ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways can you show that you are a true child of God?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) According to Paul in his epistle to the Galatians, he stressed that man was a slave under the law, but was redeemed through faith in Jesus Christ. With the coming of the son of God- Jesus Christ, our faith in him has made us children of God. Through our baptism in Christ, we have put on Christ. Therefore ,Jesus is already in us. Because of this, there is no distinction of race or sex. If we are Christ's children, then we are Abraham's offspring by faith, hence heirs of God's promise. We can not be fully matured if we remain like children in our faith. We were subject to the elemental spirits of the universe, but God in His infinite mercy sent His only son to redeem those under the law and to adopt us as sons. We can then call God our father as adopted sons. So, through Jesus, we are no longer slaves, but sons and rightful heirs of eternal life.</p><p> </p><p>(b) There are so many ways to show that we are children of God. These include:</p><p>(i) We should reject satan in every sphere of our lives and accept Christ as our saviour.</p><p>(ii) We must obey and fulfill Christian obligations and those of state also.</p><p>(iii) We must strive hard to win more souls for Christ and contribute our quota in cash and kind towards the propagation of Christianity.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the coming of the Lord according to Paul's teaching.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What does this teach us as christians?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) According to the teaching of Paul to the Thessalonians on the second coming of Jesus, he (Paul) said that Jesus went up to heaven in the presence of many witnesses and he (Jesus) promised them that he would come back again. Jesus' second coming would be witnessed after the lawless one must have deceived many with false claims of messiahship. At this point, sinners would be destroyed. Paul told the Christians in Thesalonia to get prepared for the D-day because it would be like a thief in the night. The Lord will descend from heaven with his Archangels , with sound of trumpets calling on the faithfuls to the rapture of God. The dead believers would rise and those who are still living shall join together to meet the Lord in the mid-air. He told the Thessalonian Christians not to panic nor listen to false spirits or teachers because if they are caught unawares, it would be a great disaster. Therefore, they should not be taken unprepared. They should always be awake with sober reflection.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons to be derived from the teaching as Christians include:</p><p>(i) Christians should have faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ as living evidence.</p><p>(ii) As Christians, we should help those who are weak in the faith.</p><p>(iii) Those who died in the Lord would rise in the last day to eternal glory so we should not grieve so much over them.</p><p>(iv) Christians are to live new life in Christ. </p>",
