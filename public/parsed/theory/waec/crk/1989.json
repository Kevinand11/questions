        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the story of Joseph in Canaan and indicate how he came to assume leadership role in Egypt .</p><p> </p><p>(b) Give any two leadership qualities you find in him.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Joseph's parents were Jacob and Rachel. Jacob loved his son, Joseph greatly to the extent that he made Joseph a ong robe because he was his son of old age. Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his eleven brothers. Because of the love Jacob had for Joseph, his brothers hated him. The hatred got deepened when Joseph told his brothers about the two dreams which he had and the interpretations of the dreams which showed that he would be their leader in future.</p><p>The eleven brothers were angered by this and they plotted to kill him. The eleven brothers went to graze their father's cattle at Dothan near Shechem and Joseph was sent by their father from Hebron to find out how they fared and to give them food. When they sighted him coming, they planned to kill him and to report to their father that a wild beast had killed him. However, Reuben cautioned against killing him. \" Shed no blood\", he said. Instead, Reuben made a suggestion that Joseph be thrown into a well with the intention of rescuing him later and presenting him to their father. They heeded his advice. While eating, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelite traders going to Egypt. On Judah's suggestion, Joseph was sold for twenty shekels of silver and was eventually taken to Egypt. Joseph was again resold to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officers. He became his chief steward. When Joseph refused to have an illicit affair with Potiphar's wife, he was unjustly sentenced to prison. In the prison, Joseph perfectly interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's chief butler and baker, the butler was later restored to his former position.</p><p>After some time, Pharaoh had a dream. Everybody including Pharoh's magicians tried in vain to interprete the dream. It was then that the butler remembered Joseph in prison. Joseph was sent for. He interpreted the king's dream correctly. As a result, he was made a governor in Egypt.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two leadership qualities of Joseph are:</p><p>(i) Joseph feared God as the fountain of knowledge. He served his master Potiphar with his whole heart. He was faithful to his master. Even when his master's wife wanted him to sleep with her, he feared God and did not fall into that temptation. Although he was jailed, God raised him up to a higher position.</p><p>(ii) He had great concern for those around him. When he was in prison, he loved his fellow inmates. This good quality of his made the butler to remember him in time of need.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Discuss the source of Solomon's wisdom and how he misused it.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention any four lessons we can learn from this misuse. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Solomon assumed the mantle of kingship in lsreal. He followed his father's (David) good steps by loving God. The Lord appeared to him at Gibeon when he was there to make sacrifice to God and asked him to make any request. Solomon, sensing the great task of ruling a people like Israel, asked God to grant him an understanding mind to govern his people. God was pleased with his request, He therefore granted him his request in addition to riches and honour on the condition that he would continue to do the will of God.</p><p>God also promised him long life and prosperity. As soon as Solomon was granted his request, he did what was wrong in the sight of the Lord. He married many wives especially from foreign nations which God had warned Israel not to have any social interaction with. These heathen women turned Solomon's mind away from God. No doubt, Solomon made burnt offerings and sacrifices to the gods of these heathen nations. Furthermore, Solomon embarked on expensive, wasteful and gigantic capital projects. The people were made to pay heavy taxes with forced labour to execute these projects. This caused general disaffection in the whole nation. The eventual result was the division of the kingdom into two as Solomon refused to listen to the many prophets that warned him about God's displeasure over his apostasy.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Four Lessons which can be learnt from Solomon's misuse of wisdom are:</p><p>(i) God would always punish anyone who disobeys Him no matter his position.</p><p>(ii) When we are in position of leadership, it is advisable to listen to the voice of those we are leading and consider their social well being anytime we want to impose any tax, labour, law, etc.</p><p>(iii) Solomon was at various times warned to desist from his wrong doings and return to the Lord, but he refused. We should learn to obey the voice of God in all our undertakings so that we may succeed and prosper.</p><p>(iv) Owing to his wisdom and wealth, Solomon felt arrogant and proud. This contributed to his downfall. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Trace the circumstances that caused Daniel to be cast into the lion's den.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons can we learn from this episode?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Daniel was one of the three presidents appointed by king Dairus to oversee the work of the120 satraps set up by the king over the whole kingdom of Babylon. Owing to his sterling qualities, Daniel showed his wealth of experience and worth by distinguishing himself among other presidents and Satraps. Therefore, the king made him the leader over others, but this did not go down well with his contemporaries. Consequently, they were looking for a way to implicate him before the king. To achieve this, the men suggested to the king that a decree should be promulgated by the king that, whoever prayed to any god or man other than the king within a specified period of thirty days would be thrown into the lion's den. The king was decieved to sign the decree into law. Once such an edict was passed into law according to the Medes and the Persian, it could not be revoked. Daniel knew that the king had been tricked into signing the law by his enemies, but he went back to his house and facing Jerusalem, he offered his prayers three times daily; giving thanks to God as usual. Daniel was caught in the act of praying and was promptly reported to the king.</p><p>The king perceived that the presidents and satraps had ganged up to implicate and eliminate Daniel, but he could not do anything to save him since the law could not be changed. Daniel was, consequently, thrown into the lion's den, but the king prayed for Daniel that the Lord he served should deliver him from the lions. This troubled the king to the extent that he was sleepless in the night. God sealed the lion's mouths so that they could not harm Daniel. In the morning, the king went to see whether the Lord that Daniel served had come to deliver him. He called out to him and Daniel answered that God had shut the mouths of the lions and they could not harm him. Daniel was brought out and those that had plotted evil against him and their families were thrown into the lion's den.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two lessons which can be learnt from the episode are:</p><p>(i) Daniel had faith and courage in God. This made him to be steadfast in his obedience to Him.</p><p>(ii) Those who prove to be enemies of God or enemies of those who serve Him will never go unpunished, just as the transgressors fell into the pit they dug for Daniel.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the story of the resurrection and appearance of Jesus to the women in the Gospel of Mathew.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What is the significance of the resurrection to Christians?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) There were some women who had been following the prosecution of Jesus Christ until the time he was crucified on the cross. At the point of death, these women saw everything. They saw the tomb which Joseph of Arimathea provided for the burial of Jesus Christ. Some of these women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Salome.</p><p>Early on Sunday morning, the women went to the tomb to anoint the body of Christ. On getting there, they discovered that an angel of God appeared during an earthquake to roll off the stone. The women saw the angel and became afraid just as the guards who were posted to keep watch over the grave. The angel told the women not to fear,for he knew that they were searching for Jesus who was crucified. The women were told that Jesus had risen from the dead as he (Jesus) had told his disciples. The angels invited the women to see the empty tomb. Then they were told to take the news to his disciples and that they should go and meet Him. The women were filled with great joy. They ran to the disciples to deliver the good news to them. While they were still on their way, Jesus appeared to them. They bowed down and worshipped him. He told them not to be afraid and to go and inform his disciples to meet him in Galilee.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The significance of the resurrection of Christ to Christians include:</p><p>(i) It signifies that all who die in the Lord will resurrect at the last day.</p><p>(ii) The story of the resurrection is the hope of Christian faith.</p><p>(iii) It provides us with the courage and hope that the Lord we worship and adore is a living God.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Give an account of the healing of the nobleman's son and indicate the role of faith in the miracle.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>When Jesus visited Cana again, a nobleman, an official from Capernaum came to him and begged him to come down and heal his son who was at the point of death. Jesus told him \" Unless you see signs and wonder you will not believe\". Instead of Jesus to go with him, he instructed him to go and that his son would live. The official believed Jesus and went away. As he was going home, one of his servants ran to meet him and told him that his son was well. When he was told the time the child got well, he discovered that it was the exact time Jesus told him to go home, that his son would soon recover.</p><p>The role of faith in the miracle is that any one that follows Jesus Christ and his teaching must have faith in him. This is because faith plays a major role in our relationship with Jesus. As the nobleman had faith in Jesus for the healing of his son, likewise any problem in our lives, be it infirmities or diseases would be healed if we have faith in Jesus Christ. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the election of a successor to Judas Iscariot.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons can we learn from this incident ?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) After Jesus had ascended into heaven, the disciples. gathered together in one place as Jesus had commanded them. At this point, Peter stood among the brethren who were about 120 in number. He explained the need for the position of Judas Iscariot which had been left vacant to be filled. He made reference to the Bible i.e. the book of Psalm, which says \" Let his habitation become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it; and his office let another take\". Peter gave some conditions that must be fufilled by the would-be-appointee to the vacant post. The person must have witnessed and personally seen Jesus' works and heard his words and must have been a true witness to him. Two candidates were nominated for the post. They were Joseph Justus (also called Barnabas) and Mathias. They prayed for them. They cast lots for them and the lot fell on Mathias. He was numbered with the eleven disciples as a successor of Judas.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two lessons which we can learn from the incident are:</p><p>(i) The prayer, the casting of lots and the eventual election of Mathias show that God was behind the election.</p><p>(ii) God can always raise people to do his work. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) St. Paul places much importance on the use of individual talents. Talents are special abilities which God has given to every individual. Paul tells us that there should be moderation in our attitude towards grace gifts to us. We must exercise restraint so that we do not misuse them. Instead, they must be used for the well being of our fellow human beings and in the spirit of love and happiness.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two ways which Paul's teaching on individual talents can be applied to Christian- living today are:</p><p>(i) Those that possess the gift of good voice for singing are specially endowed by God to praise Him in songs and psalms. They are given special honour in the church to carry on.</p><p>(ii) The art of teaching is also a special talent from God. Those that have the talent of teaching should organize Bible lectures with the approval of the church leaders.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Discuss Paul's teaching on the ideal family relationship.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention three areas in which many families have deviated from this teaching.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul tells us that the family is a sacred institution ordained by God. Because of this, it must be kept in mutual love and nurtured in respect among its members. According to St. Paul, a Christian family is an ideal family. All rights and obligations are to be observed as if God is the head of the family.</p><p>There are certain roles assigned to each individual family member. Some of these are:</p><p>(i) Wives must be submissive to their husbands for God has commanded that the husband is the head of the family as Jesus Christ is the head of the church.</p><p>(ii) The submissiveness of wives to their husbands must be reciprocated by their husbands with love. A husband must love his wife as Christ loves us. Wives should not be subjected to harsh treatment for they are not slaves.</p><p>(iii) Children should obey their parents for God had commanded it, \" honour your father and mother that thy days may be long on earth\".</p><p>(iv) Parents are advised (warned) not to do anything that may provoke their children. Parents should love and care for their children. As Christians, they should bring them up to fear God. Parents are to make their homes as places of moral instructions. Some parents' failure to bring their children up morally nowadays has contributed to high rate of crime and juvenile deliquency.</p><p>(v) Slaves must serve their masters as if they are serving God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Three areas in which families have deviated from these teachings are:</p><p>(i) According to Paul's injunction, wives are to be treated equally with their husbands. But African ways of life do not support this and it is a deviation from the teaching. African husbands keep absolute monopoly of wisdom and rights. They are not just heads, but absolute heads. To a large extent any decision taken by African husbands as the heads cannot be challenged by their wives.</p><p>(ii) Paul warns parents to take care of their children and bring them up in the fear of God. But the present day socio -economic situations have led the parents to abandon their responsibilities to the children. It is extremely impossible for some parents to see to the general upbringing of their children nowadays.</p><p>(iii) In many marriages today, the love that once brought the couple together is growing cold. Wives no longer respect their husbands, neither do husbands love their wives. Love is the strong foundation upon which the family is built. When a husband and wife move in opposite direction because of love of material things, the foundation of the family becomes weak. </p>",

Christians should be good citizens and obey constituted authority. They should perform their civic duties to the government by paying their taxes, rates and other approved levies. They should be ready to assist in meaningful services in their communities and should endure trials and suffering for their faith as Jesus Christ did on the cross. When they are persecuted unjustly, they should not retaliate but should pray and be sober always. They should have good relationship with their fellow Christians.</p><p>The Church leaders should love their members and look after them without expecting any material gains from them.
