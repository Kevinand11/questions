        "question": "<p>(a) Outline the circumstances that led to the gift of manna and quails in the wilderness.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What does this episode reveal of the nature of God?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) When the Israelites were on their way to the land of Canaan, they came from Elim to the wilderness of Sin. During the period, they were without food for several days. The people murmured against Moses for they wanted food. It was their wish that they were left alone in Egypt where there was plenty of food rather than to die in the wilderness. The Lord called on Moses and informed him that He (Lord) would rain bread (Manna) from heaven for them. The Lord told Moses that he should instruct the Israelites to gather a day's portion every day. The reason behind this was to test the people's faithfulness and loyalty to God. They were also instructed to store for the Sabbath day because manna would not be rairled for the day. After Moses and Aaron had taken the instruction from the Lord, they assured the Israelites that they would soon know that it was the Lord who brought them out of Egypt and they would soon see His glory, for the Lord had heard their murmuring.</p><p>God made it clear to Moses and Aaron that the people's murmuring was not directed at them, but against Him (God). The Israelites were gathered in a place and the glory of God was manifested in the clouds. In the evening, quails covered their camp; in the morning white flakes filled everywhere. Moses directed them to gather the flakes on omer, a piece according to the number of people per family, and none should be left over till the following morning. The story had it that those who disobeyed and gathered more than necessary were punished. Their bread was filled with worms. Moses did not hide his annoyance for their disobedience.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The nature of God in this episode was revealed as follows:</p><p>(i) The episode shows that even when we do not ask God for what we need, He always provides for our needs.</p><p>(ii) It equally indicates that God's endurance is unlimited. This was demonstrated by God when He endured the murmuring and ingratitude of the people of Israel.</p><p>(iii) It signifies that offenders would not go unpunished for their disobedience. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Narrate the story in which David spared the life of Saul and indicate any three significant lessons to be learnt from this episode.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The people of Zip'h revealed where David was hiding to Saul. Saul then gathered three thousand men and went after David in order eliminate him. David was told of the plot and he (David) sent spies to find out how they had prepared. David took Abishai with him and went to the army. No one saw them as they moved to where Saul was lying. David met Saul and his aides fast asleep at night. Abishai requested that he should be allowed to pin him to the ground but, David rejected Abishars request on the ground that Saul was God's anointed. Instead, David ordered Abishai to take the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head. This was done and they went away. When they had got to a vantage position, within hearing distance, David called upon Abner, rebuking him for his laxity in taking care of Saul. David asked of the whereabouts of Saul's spear and jar of water. Saul recognised David's voice and David asked why Saul should come out to seek after his life without any cause. Saul felt ashamed, although full of appreciation and gratitude to David for sparing his life. Saul then vowed that he would not harm David any more and David returned Saul's spear and his jar of water. Saul equally prayed that God would reward David for his righteousness and faithfulness.</p><p> </p><p>Three lessons that can be learnt from the episode are:</p><p>(i) We can learn that it was kind of David to spare the life of God's anointed. This showed that David respected God.</p><p>(ii) The story showed us that David's faith in God was not shaken and that he submitted to the will of God at all times.</p><p>(iii) Saul's repentance about his past misdeed and his resolution not to relapse into sin again must be commended.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What did Jeremiah and Ezekiel teach about the New Covenant ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what ways has our society deviated from this teaching?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The prophets (Jeremiah and Ezekiel) were not happy that Judah had joined Israel in worshipping foreign gods when God, after letting Israel out of Egypt, had entered into a covenant with them. God had been faithful to them as a good husband is faithful to his wife. Instead, Israel had broken the covenant and as a consequence, had been ruined. Despite this, the Lord would bring them back to their original home from the countries into which God in His wrath had driven them. There, they would live in safety and would go back to their special relationship with God.</p><p>According to Jeremiah and Ezekiel, a new covenant would be put in place to replace the old one. God would fill their hearts with the fear of God so that they would not turn away from Him. God would rejoice at their restoration, delight in their prosperity and resettle them finally in Israel. There would no longer be any need for anybody to teach his own neighbour how to know God. All the people, from the least to the greatest would know the Lord. God would inevitably forgive them of their sins, remember them forever and never turn away from doing good for them.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Our society today has deviated from this as:</p><p>(i) Nigerians have turned away from Christian standard, and have failed to listen to the dictates of God.</p><p>(ii) The Nigerian people live a life of sin and materialism.</p><p>(iii) Both the church and the state need to play prominent role in the education of the people to turn a new leaf. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Relate the parable of The Wheat and The Tares and give its interpretation.</p><p> </p><p>(b) How is this parable applicable to the church today?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Jesus told his disciples a parable of how a man sowed wheat in his field but, when night came, his enemy went there and sowed weeds among the wheat. The wheat and the weeds grew together and both bore grains. The servants went and asked their master whether it was not wheat that was sown and why the weeds grew among the wheats. Their master answered that an enemy had done that. They sought his permission to uproot the weeds from among the wheats, but their master disagreed,saying if they did, they would uproot the wheat. He said that they should allow the two to grow together until the harvest period when he would instruct the reapers to gather the weeds together for burning and the wheat to be gathered and stored in the barn. In this parable, the sower is the son of God. The field is the earth. The good seeds represent the sons of the kingdom, the weeds are the sons of evil while the enemy is the devil. The harvest is the judgement day and the reapers are the angels. It therefore follows that, just as the weeds are gathered and burnt, so also will the son of man send his angels to gather all evil doers together for destruction . They will be thrown into the fire where there will be extreme punishment for them. The righteous ones will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The parable is applicable to the church today in the sense that:</p><p>(i) In the church today, the good and the evil live and share together.</p><p>(ii) The church is empowered by God to try and punish erring members.</p><p>(iii) The final judgement is for the Lord on the judgement day.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Give an account of the miracle of healing at Bethzatha and indicate the two reasons why Jesus was criticized by the Jews.</p>",
        "answer": "<p> In Jerusalem, by the sheep gate, there was a pool called Bethzatha where a multitude of invalid people assembled. There was one of them who had been paralysed for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw the lame man and asked if he wanted to be healed, the man said he had nobody to put him into the pool. Jesus then told him to take his pallet and walk. Immediately, the lame man took his pallet and walked. That was on the Sabbath day. When the Jews saw the man who had just been healed carrying his pallet on the Sabbath, they accused him for doing what was unlawful on the Sabbath. The man told them that it was Jesus who instructed him to carry his pallet. He was told to identify the man, but he could not because Jesus had walked away into the crowd. Later in the day, he saw Jesus in the temple who warned him to sin no more, lest worse evil would befall him. The man went to tell the Jews that Jesus was the man that healed him. The Jews accused Jesus of healing on the Sabbath. Jesus told them that since his father was still working, he too was active.</p><p> </p><p>Two reasons why Jesus was criticized are:</p><p>(i) He was criticized for calling himself the son of God, thereby claiming equality with God. This was considered a blasphemy.</p><p>(ii) He was equally criticized for working on the Sabbath day, i.e. He did not keep the Sabbath law.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Narrate Peter's defence of his role in the conversion of Cornelius. What use did he make of this incident during the Council of Jerusalem ? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>After the conversion of Cornelius, the brethren in Judea learnt that the Gentiles had received the word of God through Peter. Because of this, Peter was challenged for mingling and eating with the uncircumcised Gentiles in Caesarea. Peter took time to explain how he was in a trance in Joppa and saw all sorts of animals let down in a great sheet and he was asked to kill and eat. He refused the order for three times saying that, nothing common or unclean had ever entered his month. He was for each time told not to call what God had created common or unclean.</p><p> </p><p>After this, three men from Caesarea met him and told him that Cornelius had sent them. He was told by the spirit of God to accompany them and not to make any distinction. On their arrival and after Cornelius' explanation, Peter addressed the audience, declaring that God was no respecter of persons, but those that feared Him and did what was right from every nation, would be acceptable to Him. Hardly had he completed his address when the Holy Spirit descended on Cornelius and his friends, and they spoke in tongues. They were baptized. The council members were perplexed by what they heard and they kept silence. They praised God for granting salvation to the gentiles.</p><p> </p><p>The defence of Peter was enough to silence his critics who then gave praise to God. God had given the Gentiles the Holy Spirit as He did to the apostles without any distinction. The conclusion therefore, was that the Gentiles should not be heavily yoked. The council passed a resolution on the matter and so the question of circumcision of the Gentiles was settled once and for all.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>The nine spiritual gifts as enumerated by Paul are as follows:</p><p>(i) Utterance of wisdom</p><p>(ii) Utterance of knowledge.</p><p>(iii) Prophecy.</p><p>iv) Miracle working.</p><p>(v) Faith</p><p>(vi) Distinguishing between spirits (discernment of spirits).</p><p>(vii) Various kinds of tongues.</p><p>(viii) Healing Power</p><p>(ix) Interpretation of tongues.</p><p> </p><p>Utterance of Knowledge: As a gift of the holy spirit, this is manifested in various ways. Some churches have produced men and women who are daily contributing their quota in the spread of knowledge. These are teachers, lecturers, professors working in schools, colleges and universities.</p><p>Faith: With faith in God, many churches have led the way in the work of conversion. Many sinners have been converted to saints through the process of evangelization. They have also carried the work of God to remote villages and assisted in cash and kind in erecting church and school buildings in these areas. Prophecy: Our leaders in the church have, through wise counsel, been proving that they are watchdogs of the society. They have been fulfilling prophetic roles by leading the congregation on the path of truth, thereby reducing crime and other anti-social habits including juvenile delinquency.</p><p>Miracle working: Some churches are using the power of God to perform different types of miracles. No wonder then that some newly established churches go with the name \"miracle\" as an appellation to attract more worshippers into their folds.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How did James deal with the problem of partiality in the church?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways does the church today fall short of the standard which James recommended?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) James advised all Christians to do away with any acts of partiality in the church. He said that partiality can manifest when well-dressed and poorly-dressed individuals go to church and the poorly-dressed person is asked to stand up for the well-dressed person. According to James, this is partiality. God often honours those who are despised on earth but are highly faithful in spiritual affairs because it is the earthly rich who are the oppressors of the faithful poor they drag them to court without cause. All Christians should observe the royal law which says: love your neighbour as yourself. If you show partiality, you commit sin and you are convicted by the law. For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one has become guilty of all of it. If one commits adultery, but does not kill, he is guilty of breaking the law. Therefore, all our thoughts and actions must be in consonance with observation of the law of liberty. A Christian who fails to show mercy to the oppressed will receive God's condemnation.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The Church today falls short of the standard prescribed by James in many ways:</p><p>(i) Appointment to church offices are often based on considerations other than merit.</p><p>(ii) Allocation of seats in the church during occasions depends on special status and not morality.</p><p>(iii) Contributions in terms of funds made by the poor are not recognized as that of the rich in the church.</p>",

        "question": "<p>State the behavioural patterns which Peter recommended for christian servants living among non-christians</p>",
        "answer": "<p> In Peter's letter, he advised christian servants to be loyal to their masters whether they are gentiles or the oppressive type. It is unacceptable if a servant is beaten for his wrong doing and he retaliates, for when one does evil and suffers for it patiently, he wins God's approval. Peter said that Jesus was a good example of the suffering servant who should be emulated. Jesus was sinless and innocent, yet he was reviled, but he did not revile in return. When he suffered, he did not threaten his persecutors. He trusted in God who would give right judgement in the end. He died for our sin and by his wound, we are healed. We were formerly straying like sheep but Jesus has been our good shepherd who has shown us the way of salvation. </p>",
