        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the first account of the creation.</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways does this account demonstrate the nature of God?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, but the earth had no visible form. It was full of darkness and the spirit of God moved over the face of the waters that covered the earth. God said let there be light and there was light, God separated the light from darkness and called the light day and the darkness He called night.</p><p>On the second day, God made dry land to appear. He called the dry land, earth and the water, He called sea. On the fourth day, God made the sun and the moon- the sun to shine in the day and the moon at night. He also made the stars. On the fifth day, God ordered the waters to bring forth living creatures. Birds of the air were also created to fly across the firmament and God blessed them all. On the sixth day, God ordered the earth to bring forth living creatures, cattle, creeping things and beasts.</p><p>Then, He finally made man in His own image - male and female. God blessed them saying, \"Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue them\". On the seventh day, God rested from the work of creation. He blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The nature of God as demonstrated in the story of the creation can be seen as:</p><p>(i) God has sovereignty over all creations / God has control over situations .</p><p>(ii) God's spoken word translated into visible reality.</p><p>(iii) No creature determines its own nature but God.</p><p>(iv) God delegates power to man, e.g man was made in God's image to have power over all creatures.</p><p>(v) God was not created by anybody. He is the Alpha and Omega.</p><p>(vi) God is a God of order, not of anarchy.</p><p>(vii) Creative action did not stop, it continues with the innate power of creation.</p><p>(viii) God is a God of perfection, all that He created was good.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How did David spare the life of Saul?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons can we derive from the story? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) David's hiding place was revealed to Saul by the Ziphites and Saul went with three thousand troops of Israel to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph. David sent out spies to know if it was true that Saul had come after him. He asked for volunteers to accompany him.  At night, David and Abishai went to Saul's camp and found Saul sleeping within the encampment with his spear stuck to the ground. Abishai asked for permission to slay Saul, but David refused because the Lord forbids anyone to kill the Lord's anointed. However, he took Saul's spear and bottle (Jar) of water and went away. No man saw them (David and Abishai) because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them. From a far distance, David called upon Abner and condemned his incompetence. Saul recognized David's voice. David pleaded his innocence to Saul and Saul repented, saying, I have done wrong; return my son, David for I will no more do you harm. David gave back Saul's spear through one of Saul's men and prayed for Saul. Saul blessed David and they returned to their respective homes.</p><p> </p><p>(b) From the account of how David spared Saul's life, a lot has to be learnt. These include:</p><p>(i) Readiness to forgive.</p><p>(ii) Recognition / acceptance of our fault</p><p>(iii) Respect for authorities</p><p>(iv) Respect for God's word / instruction</p><p>(v) God protects His own; for instance, He caused sleep upon David's enemies.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Describe Hosea's marital experience and how it demonstrates God's love for Israel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>God asked Hosea to take to himself a harlot as wife. He took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim and she bore him a son. And the Lord said to him \"call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. She conceived again and bore a daughter called Not Pitied, for God will not pity the house of Israel. She bore a third child, a son named Not my people, for Israel is no longer the people of God, neither is He their God. Gomer's faithlessness later made her abandon Hosea and the children. In love, Hosea paid to bring her back and sent her children to plead with their mother - all in vain. Inspite of her faithlessness and disappointment by her lovers, Hosea's love for Gomer still persisted.</p><p>Hosea's marital experience and love for his wife was a demonstration of God's love for Israel in the following ways:</p><p>(i) Inspite of Israel's unfaithfulness, God still remained faithful.</p><p>(ii) God promised future glory and unity of Israel and Judah.</p><p>(iii) He also provide their needs inspite of disappointment. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Narrate the parable of the Sower and state two lessons that could be drawn from it.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The parable of the sower is all about a certain man who went out to sow his seeds. As he sowed, some seeds fell along the path and the birds came and devoured them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they had not much soil, so immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, when the sun rose, they were scorched, and since they had no roots, they withered away. Other seeds fell on thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them to dead. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grains, some hundred fold, some sixty and some thirty.</p><p>Several lessons could be drawn from the parable of the sower:</p><p>(i) There are various responses to the word of God which the preacher preaches; each type of response determines the reward of the recipient. Thus, we are in a position to choose between punishment from God or eternal life.</p><p>(ii) Positive response and passing it on to the others leads to eternal life.</p><p>(iii) If response is negative, then follows damnation.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) As Jesus and his disciples were walking along the road, a man said to him \"I will follow wherever you go\". Jesus replied, \"foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the son of man has no where to lay his head.\" Jesus said to another man, \"follow me\", but the man replied, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father\". Jesus said to him, \"let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\" Another man said, \"I will follow you Lord; but, first, let me go back and bid goodbye to my family\". Jesus told him that no one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Demands of discipleship are:</p><p>(i) Jesus knew that this man was expecting a life of pleasure and satisfaction in discipleship. He wanted to enrich himself with these earthly requirements. Jesus disabused his mind by telling him that discipleship involved total sacrifice - physical and spiritual. He thought that it is a bed of roses to follow Jesus.</p><p>(ii) Jesus told the man that those who do not receive the gospel are spiritually dead.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the event in Bethany which made Jesus speak of himself as the \"Resurrection and the Life\".</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons can we draw from the declaration? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Jesus had a friend whose name was Lazarus. He lived in Bethany. When he fell ill, his sisters, Mary and Martha sent for Jesus, but he said Lazarus' illness was not unto death. Jesus delayed for four days before he arrived with his disciples. Many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother who had died. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, and told Jesus that if he had been there, her brother would not have died. However, she believed that whatever Jesus asked from God would be granted. Jesus answered Martha that Lazarus would rise again. Martha said that she knew that Lazarus would rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus then said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me though he dies yet shall he live and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die\". Martha confessed her faith in him as the Christ, the son of God who came into the world.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons to be drawn from the declaration are:</p><p>(i) The believer in Christ passes from physical death of the body to life eternal in heaven.</p><p>(ii) Jesus gave his life for the world so that believers will live with him for ever.</p><p>(iii) The raising of Lazarus manifested the glory of God. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul desires a society where there is no exaggerated view of one's self esteem but, rather, an environment where people reflect sober judgement. Instead of thinking of himself too highly, a man should measure himself by the standard of what he believes by faith. Paul pointed out that the body consists of many members which perform different functions and he reminded the Romans that though they were many, yet, they were one body in Christ. Individually, they were members of one another, though gifts might differ according to the grace given to them. They must use the gifts for the benefit of the community and church - if prophecy, in proportion to their faith; if service, in their serving. He who teaches, in his teaching; he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who contributes, in liberality; he who gives aid, with zeal; he who acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways of applying talents are: Singing, service, giving, energy. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)The Philippians dispatched through Epaphroditus some monetary gift to Paul while he was in prison in Rome. To show his gratitude and appreciation for the gift from the church which he had founded, Paul wrote to the church expressing his gratitude. His joy, however, was based on the spirit of sacrifice that motivated their action. In giving and receiving, the Philippians received Paul and God's approval. He (Paul), therefore, prayed that God might continue to satisfy all their needs according to His riches in glory as long as they sustained their faith in Christ Jesus.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways by which one can manifest the true sense of giving in his community are:</p><p>(i) Meeting the needs of the under privileged, the aged and the sick in society by offering voluntary service to them.</p><p>(ii) Rendering of voluntary (willing) service to schools and churches, e.g. by keeping the premises tidy.</p><p>(iii) Joining youth organizations for more organized welfare services to society.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Give the main features of Paul's letter to Philemon</p><p> </p><p>(b) State two reasons why a Christian should forgive others. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul began his letter to Philemon by first thanking God for the love which he learnt Philemon had in serving the Lord and toward the church. As Philemon's benefactor, Paul claimed that he had a right to command him to do his bidding but he would, however, not use compulsion.Rather, he chose to use persuasion in asking Philemon to accept back his former slave, Onesimus who had wronged him but had now become Paul's son in Christ. Again, Onesimus had previously made himself useless to Philemon, but now as a Christian, he could become useful to both Philemon and Paul. He was, therefore, sending Onesimus back with love-though he would have wished to retain him in his service in Rome. He would however not do so without first getting Philemon's consent in order to remove any shade of command. Paul then observed that Onesimus had departed from his master (for a short while) so that at his return, he might have him for ever, but this time, no longer as a slave, but more importantly, as a Christian brother. He, therefore, appealed to Philemon, if he still regarded him as a partner in Christ, to receive Onesimus back as he would receive Paul himself. If Onesimus owed him anything, he should charge same to his own (Paul's) account with assurance that he would pay it back on his next visit. In the mean time, he should prepare a guest room for him and pray to God to make his visit a reality.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Reasons why a christian should show forgiveness include:</p><p>(i) It shows obedience to Jesus' injunction</p><p>(ii) Forgiveness restores peace and love in family, community.</p><p>(iii) Forgiveness of our sins by God depends on the extent to which we forgive others. </p>",
