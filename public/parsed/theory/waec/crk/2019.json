        "answer": "<p>A. REASONS FOR THE PRONOUNCEMENT (1 KINGS 11:1-13)</p><p> </p><p>i. When Solomon had established himself as King of lsrael after his father David, he started loving many foreign women of whom God had warned him not to marry.</p><p>ii. Those women included the daughter of Pharaoh and Moabite, Edomite, Sidonian and Hittite Women.</p><p>iii. The reason was that they would surely turn away his heart after their gods.</p><p>iv. Thus, during the latter part of Solomon's reign, his heart turned away from God who had appeared to him twice.</p><p>V. This came about because he married many foreign wives against God's will.</p><p>vi, He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines and these women-led him astray.</p><p>vii. Solomon built high places for the gods of his foreign wives who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods there,</p><p>viii, He built high places for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, Molech the abomination. of Ammon,</p><p>ix, God was angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the God of Israel.</p><p>x. His marriage of foreign wives also led to the adulteration of the worship of Yahweh.</p><p>xi. God was not pleased with Solomon, because he did not follow Him wholeheartedly as his father, David did.</p><p>xi. God, therefore, decided to divide the Davidic Kingdom of Israel into two after the death of Solomon.</p><p>xiii. The Lord said to Solomon \"Since this has been your mind and you have not kept my Covenant and status which l have commanded you, I will surely tear the Kíngdom from you and give it to your servant\".</p><p>xiv.

But finally, in accordance 1lse with Jewish law, two witnesses came forward and accused Jesus of saying that he would destroy the temple Jon in Jerusalem and in three days build another.</p><p>vi. The temple stood as the centre of Judaism; thus, Jesus was attacking the heart of the Jewish religion.</p><p>vii. The high priest then asked Jesus under oath whether he was the Messiah, the son of the Blessed One.</p><p>vii. Jesus replied affirmatively that he was the Messiah.</p><p>ix.

The high priest then tore his garment as a sign of righteous indignation and asked if they needed a further evidence against this blasphemy.</p><p>xi. According to the high priest, Jesus had spoken blasphemy, so, he sought to the decision of the council.</p><p>xii. The whole council condemned Jesus and said that he deserved death as a ber penalty for blasphemy.</p><p>xiii.

        "answer": "<p>A. JESUS' AGONY AND ARREST IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE (MATTHEW 26:36-56)</p><p>i. Jesus and his disciples went to the garden of Gethsemane to pray.</p><p>ii.

He then went a little farther on and fell tọ the ground to pray, saying my father if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; neverthless God's will should be done</p><p>vi. This prayer shows the profound humanity of Jesus and his resolute courage and submission to the will of God.</p><p>vii. The cup in this context is a symbol or deep sorrow and suffering.</p><p>viii. Jesus came back to the three, Peter, James and John found them sleeping and he asked Peter whether they could not watch with him for one hour.</p><p>ix. Jesus then told them to watch and pray so that they would not enter into temptation.</p><p>x. He said the spirit is willing but the body is weak.</p><p>xi.

Some of the Jews argued with Stephen but they could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke.</p><p>iv. They instigated some men who accused Stephen of speaking blasphemous words against God and Moses.</p><p>v Specifically, that Jesus of Nazareth would destroy the temple, and change the customs which Moses delivered to them.</p><p>vi. By Jewish law, the accusations leveled against Stephen constituted serious offence punishable by death.</p><p>vii. In his defence, Stephen tried to prove that even in the past, God did not confine His presence to the temple at Jerusalem.</p><p>viii. He decided to trace the history of the Jews to show that God is universal and does not only dwell in the temple.</p><p>ix. He cited the example of how God appeared to Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia and asked him to go and live in Haran and Abraham obeyed.</p><p>x. He stressed that God told Abraham that his descendants would become slaves in another country where they would be maltreated for four hundred years</p><p>xi. But God would punish that nation which enslaved them and later Abraham's decendants would go out and Worship him in the land of Canaan.</p><p>Xii.

He says when one's faith is tested through trials, one becomes steadfast and later becomes perfect and complete.</p><p>v. According to James, if anyone lacks wisdom, he should ask God in prayer and he would have it generously.</p><p>vi. James holds the view that one must pray in faith without doubting</p><p>Vil.
