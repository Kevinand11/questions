        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the role of Joshua in the story of the twelve spies, indicating the reasons why God chose him to succe Moses.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What four lessons can church leaders learn from this story? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Moses selected twelve spies to spy out the land of Canaan. Joshua, son of Nun was one of them. They were instructed to find out whether they would be able to conquer it or not. When the spies came back, there was disparity in the report because there was division among them. The majority report presented by ten of the spies dismayed the people and they wished they could go back to Egypt instead of being consumed by the giants in the land of Canaan. Joshua and Caleb presented the minority report. Their report was a favourable one, although the people did not believe in it. In their report, they said that the land which they had spied out was a very good land. If the Lord delighted in them, they would be in the land which they said flew with milk and honey.</p><p>Joshua warned them not to rebel against the Lord. He disabused their minds and cautioned them not to fear the people of the land. He strengthened their courage that the canaanites would be like food to them if God was with them. God commanded Moses to appoint Joshua as his (Moses) successor because Joshua was valiant and charismatic. He possessed all what a man requires to be a good leader. He feared and trusted God. This was shown in the report he presented. Moses ordained him by laying his hand upon him.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Four lessons that could be learnt by the church leaders from the story are:</p><p>(i) Many of our church leaders today fear certain people in the church probably because of their riches and wealth. Joshua did not fear the people. He reported the situation of things as they were. The church leaders of today should say what they see without fear or favour.</p><p>(ii) The church leaders of today should fear God and trust in Him. God is the over-all controller of the universe.</p><p>(iii) The church leaders should copy the outstanding qualities possesed by Joshua for the role he played among the twelve spies.</p><p>(iv) The church leaders should not think of what people would say, no matter the situation, even at the point of death. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) To what extent was the moral weakness of Eli's children due to their father's lack of parental responsibility?</p><p> </p><p>(b) How did God react to this lapse?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The two sons of Eli (Hophni and Phinehas) were useless and hopeless. Owing to their irresponsible behaviour, God pronounced the doom that would befall Eli's family through Samuel. Their father (Eli) knew this but due to his weakness, he could not caution his sons. The sons of Eli were bad in their behaviour to the extent that when the people wished to make sacrifice of peace offering on the altar of the Lord, they would seize them and take their own share with force. They would take with their fork the portion of the sacrificed meat they preferred in its raw form as they would not allow it to be cooked.</p><p>This attitude did not please God and He punished them for it at a later date. Eli was a good and just man but failed in his parental duties. As a result of his inability to caution and discipline his two sons, God pronounced judgement on the family. God told Samuel in a vision to pronounce the wrath of God on Eli's family. When Eli had the message, he did not object to the decision of God because God had control over His creatures. The sons of Eli went to war with the Amalekites taking along with them the ark of God. The Israelites lost the battle and the two sons of Eli were killed and the ark of God was captured. When Eli heard this, most especially that the ark of God had been captured, he fell head-long and died in the process.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Reaction of God to Eli's lapses were as follows:</p><p>(i) The ark of God was taken away from Israel.</p><p>(ii) The priestly position was taken away from Eli's family.</p><p>(iii) In the war that was fought, the two sons of Eli were killed.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Why did Jeremiah proclaim God's punishment on Judah?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention any two things which Jeremiah would have condemned in present-day Nigeria.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) God called Jeremiah to deliver or save the people of Israel. The sins of Israel were revealed by Jeremiah who pointed out that punishment was inevitable. He urged them to repent from their sins or else God would invoke His punishment on them. The people were reminded by God through Jeremiah of His past favours and he charged them with faithlessness to their first love as shown by their adultery. The priests, the rulers and the prophets were all alike. They compromised the worship of God with the worship of Baal. The priests concerned themselves more with gains than with worship and the prophets also became corrupted by the general idolatry and immorality in the land. Because of this, punishment was inevitable and Judah would not be saved. Despite its tight security, Judah would be desolated as a punishment for rebellion and faithlessness.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What Jeremiah would like to condemn in present day Nigeria include:</p><p>(i) The Nigerian society is full of vices such as nepotism, bribery and corruption, religious immorality and all sorts of ills that characterised the social and economic sphere of Judah then.</p><p>(ii) The religious leaders of present day Nigeria are not faithful just as we had during the time of Jeremiah. They worship money as against the true worshipping of God.</p><p>(iii) The proliferation of churches in the country today would have attracted Jeremiah's attention and total condemnation.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Jesus called the twelve disciples and sent them out in twos. He gave them authority over the devil and evil spirits. He instructed them not to take bread, bag or money on their journey. They could take a staff, wear sandals and put on one tunic. If they entered a house and they were welcomed they were to stay there till their departure. If any place did not receive them or listen to them, they should shake off the dust from their feet as a testimony against them, as they left there.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The differences between Matthew and Mark accounts are:</p><p>(i) The account of Matthew shows that they were sent to the Jews alone to prove that Jesus was their Messiah while Mark said they were generally directed to Jews and non-Jews.</p><p>(ii) Matthew makes use of kingdom of heaven while Mark uses kingdom of God.</p><p>(iii) Matthew does not mention the names of the twelve apostles but Mark does.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How does John present Jesus as the door and the good shepherd?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways does this teaching relate to leadership role among Christians?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) In John's gospel, Jesus describes himself as the door and .the good shepherd. He says the shepherd must pass through the door whenever he wants to feed his sheep or take them out for grazing. He says that the sheep recognize their owner and the owner of the sheep calls them by name and they recognize his voice. The sheep would run away from the hired man for they do not know him. The thief would come through the window. For he is not the owner. The sheep would run away from him. Jesus expects all good shepherd to enter through the door and not to jump in through the window., whoever does that is a thief. The sheep would not follow the person whom they do not known. They would run away from such a person. Jesus equally says that He is the door to the sheep. All those who came before Him are thieves, the sheep did not listen to them nor follow them. He goes on further to say that He is the door, if anybody enters by Him he will be saved. The thief comes to steal. Jesus comes to give abundant life so that they may have it abundantly.</p><p> </p><p>(b) This teaching relates to leadership role among Christians in the following ways:</p><p>(i) The teaching illustrates the fact that leadership involves taking risks to help those being led.</p><p>(ii) Jesus as the lamb, makes a great sacrifice for the sake of others. So Christian leaders should be ready to help others without counting the cost.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you', Discuss the fulfilment of this promise and the reaction of the people who witnessed it.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Of what significance is the descent of the Holy Spirit to the Church? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) After the ascension of Jesus, the apostles gathered together at a place in Jerusalem. As they were praying together, the Holy Spirit came down upon them. There came a sound of wind from heaven, filling the house where they were. The sound was followed by tongues of fire appearing and resting on their heads. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and started speaking in tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. This happened on the Pentecost day. The apostles then became bold and began to testify and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Those who were in Jerusalem on that day for the feast of Pentecost were surprised when they heard the apostles speaking in their various native tongues. Some asked whether the apostles were Galileans or not as they understood what they were saying very clearly. Some of those who heard what the apostles were saying mocked and accused them of drunkenness, but some devout men among them marvelled and gave thanks to God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The significance of the gift of the Holy Spirit to the church include:</p><p>(i) It brought about the events that marked the beginning of the church.</p><p>(ii) Many people were converted and the number of the apostles increased.</p><p>(iii) It made the disciples to be bold and they acquired healing power. They were able to proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Why did Paul commend the virtue of giving as shown by the Philippians?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Suggest four situations when a Christian should give.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) When Paul was preaching the gospel of God to the people of Thessalonica, the Philippians sent him money for his needs on two occasions. This, the Philippians did to reduce his suffering in prison. Paul wrote through Epaphroditus to commend them for their kind gesture. He expressed his gratitude for the aid sent by the Philippians and for their concern for him. Paul in his own way appealed to Christians to give generously as the people of Macedonia did. He showed his appreciation for what the Philippians did by writing to thank them. He also made us to understand that every person would be rewarded according to his manner of giving and that God always help those who give generously.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Situations when a Christian should give are:</p><p>(i) When a neighbour is in need</p><p>(ii) He should give when he is not expecting anything in return.</p><p>(iii) A Christian should donate generously to the development of the society, e.g. during building of schools, hospitals, town halls, churches, etc.</p><p>(iv) A Christian should visit motherless homes and give them gifts. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) James advised Christians to endure all trials and to ask all things with faith because any person who doubts cannot receive anything. He also advised Christians to show joy in all things because whatever happens to us is meant by God to serve a purpose. For our prayers to be effective, it must be God - centred, not self-centred. We must have faith and also make our hearts to be in tune with God. To pray effectively, we must always sincerely confess our sins. James advised Christians to pray whenever they are in difficulties. While praying, they must give thanks to God. When any Christian has occasion to rejoice, he should sing praises to God. James admonishes Christians to confess their sins and pray for one another, since the serious prayer of a good man works miracles.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Factors which may hinder the effectiveness of prayer are:</p><p>(i) Lack of concentration</p><p>(ii) Lack of faith</p><p>(iii) The order or arrangement of prayer which must include thanksgiving, confession of sins, etc.</p><p>(iv) Sin</p>",

        "question": "<p>What, according to Peter, should be the right Christian attitude to persecution and suffering? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Any person who is ready to work for Christ must be ready to face persecution in one form or the other. God said that those who suffer persecution must be joyful because they would have their rewards for this in heaven. Peter advised Christians not to be distressed when they have trials for they are protected by the power of God through faith for salvation. Christians should believe in God so that the proof of their faith may be more precious than gold which is perishable and may be found to result in praise, glory and honour at the end. It is equally stressed that Christians should be happy to share in Christ's sufferings because they will be specially glorified with Jesus Christ who suffered many things so as to redeem us. </p><p>Christians are advised not to be conformed to their former lust which they had through ignorance but that they should conduct themselves with fear while on earth. They should love respect and fear God so as to walk in perfection in his ways</p>",
