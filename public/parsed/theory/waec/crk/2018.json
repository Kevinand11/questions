The spies were also asked to find out whether the inhabitants were weak or strong/few or many/ if the cities were fortified or not.</p><p>iv. After wandering for forty days, the reported that the land was fruitful.</p><p>v. As proof, the spies came to the valley of Eschol where they cut a branch with a cluster of grapes.</p><p>vi. They also cut pomegranates and figs to show that the land was very fertile (flowing with milk and honey).</p><p>vii. However, they added that the people who lived on the land were strong.</p><p>viii.

According to them, God would help them to defeat the Canaanites.</p><p>xiii. They rent their clothes and encouraged the Israelites not to be afraid.</p><p>xiv. But as a result of the report given by the majority of the spies, the Israelites complained bitterly against Moses, saying it would have been to endure slavery in Egypt than to die in the wilderness.</p><p>xv.

        "answer": "<p>(A) THE DEATH OF SAUL ON MOUNT GILBOA (1 SAMUEL 31:1-13)</p><p>i. The Philistines fought the Israelites at Moun Gilboa where Israel suffered defeat as they fled.</p><p>ii. They overtook Saul and his sons and succeeded in killing them (Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua).</p><p>iii. As the war got intensified, the Philistines archers hit and wounded Saul badly.</p><p>iv. Saul requested that his armour bearer kill so as to avoid being killed by the uncircumcised Philistines.</p><p>v. Saul feared the Philistines would make a sport of his body.</p><p>vi. When the armour bearer refused to kill him, Saul committed suicide by falling on his sword.</p><p>vii. Seeing Saul dead, the armour bearer also killed himself.</p><p>viii. The Israelites fled from their cities on hearing the death of Saul and his sons.</p><p>ix. The next day, the Philistines settled in the abandoned cities of Israel and sent words of victory over Israel to all their men in Philistine.</p><p>x. Saul's head was cut off and his armour stripped off as trophies of their victim.</p><p>xi. These were sent into the temple of Ashtaroth to ascribe the victory to their gods.</p><p>xii.

However, the people of Jabesh-Gilead went bravely at night to remove Saul and his sons' bodies from Bethshan.</p><p>xiv. The bodies were brought to Jabesh where they were burnt and the remains buried under the tamarisk tree.</p><p>xv. This was to avoid further abuse and humiliation/insult on the Israelities.</p><p>xvi.

        "answer": "<p>(A) PUNISHMENTS AMOS WARNED ISRAEL ABOUT (AMOS 2:6, 4; 5:1-24, 7:10-17,8)</p><p>i. As Amos identified the transgressions of Israel, God made it clear to them that He would not revoke the punishments if they refused to repent.</p><p>ii. Amos prophesied that the Samaritan women would be taken to exile in hooks like a fish and cast into Harmon.</p><p>iii. The women who supported their husbands to oppress the poor would be humiliated and also taken into exile.</p><p>iv. People who cheated the poor to build hewn stone houses would not dwell in them nor would they live to drink the wine of the vineyards they planted. They would suffer exile as a punishment.</p><p>v.

This implies that a nation would attack and defeat Israel and send them into exile.</p><p>ix.

Worship involving sacrifices, prayers, songs on the feast and sacred days would incur God's displeasure, hatred and rejection.</p><p>xii.

All the synoptic gospels reported the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, thus their account were very identical.</p><p>ii. According to the gospels, Jesus came down from Nazareth of Galilee to be baptized by John the Baptist in the river Jordan.</p><p>iii. Matthew records the John recognized Jesus as the expected Messiah when he saw Him.</p><p>iv. He wondered why Jesus should come to him for baptism since Jesus was superior to him.</p><p>v. John, therefore, became hesitant in baptizing Jesus.</p><p>vi. However, Jesus persuaded John to baptize him saying, let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.</p><p>vii. John then agreed and had Jesus baptized.</p><p>viii. As Jesus came out of the water, the heavens opened and the Spirit of the Lord descended upon Him like a dove.</p><p>ix. Then a voice was heard from heaven, saying, \"This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased.\"</p><p>x. The text above alluded to the baptism of Jesus as an event that marked Jesus' call into the ministry.</p><p>xi. The voice quoted confirmed Jesus as the Messiah/ anointed son/the Christ.</p><p>xii. Jesus got baptized in order to identify Himself with the sinners He came to redeem.</p><p>xiii. The Holy Spirit which came upon Jesus led and guided Him to do God's will.</p><p>xiv. Going to John for baptism was a sign of lending support to John's work.</p><p>xv. There is disparity among the synoptic gospels about the time the dove descended on Jesus; while Matthew and Mark said that this happened as Jesus was being baptized, Luke said it happened after the baptism.</p><p>xvi. Similarly, only Matthew reported John's reluctance to baptize Jesus.</p><p>xvii. Luke reported that after He had been baptized, Jesus prayed and the heavens opened and the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, descended upon Him.</p><p>xviii. The voice from heaven made Jesus conscious of his Messiahship and of His future suffering.</p><p>xix. The significance of the voice at Jesus' baptism indicates that he had the fullest realization that he was the messiah through suffering, service and obedience to God.</p><p>xx. By submitting to John's baptism, Jesus gave his approval of John's ministry of baptism and repentance for the forgiveness of sins. </p><p> </p><p>(B) STEPS TO TAKE TO BECOME COMMITTED TO GOD</p><p>i.

According to the Synoptic gospels, women were the first to go to the tomb of Jesus. </p><p>ii. Matthew wrote that the women went to the tomb after the Sabbath was fully completed. Mark said it was after the Sabbath had passed and very early in the morning at the rising of the sun.</p><p>iii. The women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Salome. Luke added Joana, the wife of Chuza.</p><p>iv. According to Mark, these four women brought sweet spices to anoint the body of Jesus for further embalming.</p><p>v. While on their way, the women wondered who would help them roll away the rock at the entrance of the tomb.</p><p>vi. Mathew, however, reported that there was a great earthquake before the women got there.</p><p>vii. An angel of the Lord from heaven rolled back the stone and sat upon it.</p><p>viii. For fear of the angel, the guards were frightened and became like dead men.</p><p>ix. The angel told the women not to be afraid, for Jesus had risen and they should come and see where he was laid.</p><p>x. The angel told them to go quickly and tell the disciples that he had arisen and was going to Galilee where they would meet him.</p><p>xi. Matthew did not say that the angel appeared to the women but only to the guards.</p><p>xii. According to Mark, when the women entered the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right side, in a white robe and when they went in, they did not find the body of Jesus; thus, they were perplexed.</p><p>xiii. The women then saw the vision of the angel who gave them information regarding the resurrection of Christ.</p><p>xiv. They were asked to inform the disciples. Mark made emphasis to Peter.</p><p>xv. The women left quickly from the tomb with awe and ran to tell the disciples that Jesus had arisen.</p><p>xvi. But before then, Jesus had appeared to them, saluting them, 'Hail' as they took hold of his feet and worshipped him.</p><p> </p><p>(B) ROLES OF WOMEN IN THE CHURCH TODAY</p><p>i. Some women study hard and with faith, they become Pastors, Rev. Sisters, and Prophetesses/ some women are powerful prayer warriors.</p><p>ii. Others also help as lay readers and Catechists/ Ushers/ Evangelists/ Preachers.</p><p>iii. They help in the liturgy by joining the choir to sing in the church.</p><p>iv. Some give out their properties (like houses) for the use of the church, e.g. cell/home fellowship meetings, leaders meetings, etc.</p><p>v. Others adopt and raise Priests out of their bounty/ become benefactors.</p><p>vi. Most of the cleaning activities to keep the church tidy and other church decorations are spearheaded by women.</p><p>vii. Women also play major roles in the running of orphanages, crèches, schools and vocational institutions of churches.</p><p>viii. Charity works of the church like distribution of aids and catering for the poor, sick and the marginalised are mostly done by women/ distribution of communion elements.</p><p>ix.

When Herod realised that the death of James pleased the Jews, he went ahead to arrest Peter.</p><p>iv. This arrest took place during the celebration of the feast of the unleavened bread.</p><p>v. Herod intended to have Peter killed after the Passover celebrations.</p><p>vi. The night before the day Herod planned to kill Peter, Peter was bound with chains and placed between two soldiers/ he was heavily guarded to prevent his escape.</p><p>vii. While Peter was in prison, constant prayers were said on his behalf.</p><p>viii. As Peter was asleep, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and a light shone in the cell.</p><p>ix. The angel touched and woke him up, saying, \"Get up quickly.\"</p><p>x. Immediately, the chains fell off from his hands and the angel told him to dress up Which Peter obeyed.</p><p>xi.

When the angel left Peter, he realised that the Lord had sent an angel to rescue him from the power of Herod.</p><p>xv. Peter immediately went to the house of Mary the mother of John Mark where the brethren had gathered to pray for him in the middle of the night.</p><p>xvi.

        "answer": "<p>(A) JAMES' ARGUMENT ON FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD (JAMES 1:22-27; 2:14-26)</p><p>i. James advised Christians to live according to the word of the Lord which they had heard.</p><p>ii. He said it would be no use to hear the word and fail to put it into practice.</p><p>iii. According to James, if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like someone who sees himself in a mirror and turns away and immediately forgets himself.</p><p>iv. James points out that he who observes the perfect law of liberty and perseveres in it by acting and not only being a hearer would be blessed in his doing.</p><p>v. According to James, God's blessing comes through works and not faith.</p><p>vi. James was of the opinion that if one thinks he is religious but does not bridle his tongue, he deceives his heart and his religion is vain.</p><p>vii. He held the view that practical and unidentified religion before God entails the visitation of orphans and widows in their affliction.</p><p>viii. And also keeping oneself unstained from the world.</p><p>ix. James said it is of no use to say you have faith but have no works to demonstrate the faith you have.</p><p>x. He taught that faith must be combined with practical works to produce the desired results.</p><p>xi. According to James, if someone was poorly clothed and hungry and you asked him to go in peace and be filled without providing the clothes and food for them, you are not backing your faith with works.</p><p>xii. Hence, faith without works is dead and useless.</p><p>xiii. He asserted that it is not enough to believe in God.</p><p>xiv. Belief in the only true. God is good, for even the devil also believes in God, but does not do the will of Him. Hence, faith in God without works is unacceptable.</p><p>xv. James cited two Old Testament figures who exhibited faith and works in unison. For example, Abraham justified his faith by works when he was prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac.</p><p>xvi. According to James, faith is justified by works; hence, Abraham believed in God and it was counted to him as righteousness and he was called a friend of God because he acted on his faith.</p><p>xvii. A person is therefore justified by works and not by faith alone.</p><p>xviii. Similarly, Rahab, the prostitute justified her faith by works when she received the messengers of Joshua and sent them out by another way.</p><p>xix. James concluded by saying that as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead.</p><p>xx. Faith should manifest itself in the love of God and service to humankind and not the mere expression of it by words alone. </p><p> </p><p>(B) BENEFITS OF FAITH TO A CHRISTIAN</p><p>i. Faith helps Christians to believe and trust God/have fellowship with Him.</p><p>ii. It enables Christians to be committed to God/depend and rely on Him.</p><p>iii. It assures Christians of eternal salvation.</p><p>iv. It shows that Christians are not under law but under grace.</p><p>v. It is by faith that Christians face life's challenges with courage and strength, e.g. persecution.</p><p>vi. Faith motivates Christians to do good works in all fields, e.g. Education, Medicare, Evangelism, caring for the poor and the needy.</p><p>vii. It enables believers to have hope/grow spiritually/keep God's commandments.</p><p>viii. It promotes healing/it is a factor in receiving miracles. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(A) REASONS WHY CHRISTIANS SHOULD REMAIN LOYAL TO THEIR MASTERS IN ALL SITUATIONS — (1 PETER 2:18-25)</p><p>i. Christians should be law-abiding and have respect for constituted authorities.</p><p>ii. Christians should discharge their civic duties and responsibilities promptly to all men/masters even if they were gentle or harsh towards them. </p><p>iii. Peter taught that a good Christian should submit himself and respect every human institution, including the authorities of the state, e.g. Governors, etc.</p><p>iv. For it is God who appointed kings to punish wrongdoers and to reward those who do good. </p><p>v. He stressed that the Christians' good behaviour would put to shame the ignorance of foolish men.</p><p>vi. As men who have been liberated from the curse of the law, a good Christian citizen should live as a freeman without using his freedom as a pretext for evil.</p><p>vii. But rather, he should live as an obedient servant of God.</p><p>viii. Besides, he should respect every man and love the brotherhood of believers.</p><p>ix. Furthermore, he should fear God and honour the king and rulers.</p><p>x. Peter cited the case of the unjust suffering of Christ as an example worthy of emulation / He was sinless yet without retaliation</p><p>x.

Ahab married Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, King of the Sidonians.</p><p>2. She was a staunch worshipper of Baal of Phoenicia.</p><p>3. Jezebel was allowed by Ahab to bring into Israel the worship of Baal together with several Baal prophets and Prophets of Asherah.</p><p>4. She tried making Baalism state religion of Israel.</p><p>5.

The altars of Yahweh were also cut down.</p><p>8. Ahab helped in the promotion of Baalism as he used state resources to build temples for Baal.</p><p>9. Ahab perpetrated grave social injustices during his reign eg. He had Naboth killed and took over his vineyard.</p><p>10. Many Israelites deserted Yahweh to worship Baal.</p><p>11.

Tolerance/respect for the views of other religions/ avoid partiality/show love for all religions.</p><p>2. Have understanding and concern for others/ avoid derogatory remarks.</p><p>3.

After the cleansing of Naaman’s leprosy at river Jordan, he returned to the man of God (Elisha) with large amount of gifts.</p><p>2. He presented the gifts to Elisha the prophet, but he refused to accept them and dispatched him even after persuasion.</p><p>3. When Naaman had gone a short distance with his gifts, Gehazi, Elisha’s servant, followed him to request for the items his master had rejected.</p><p>4. Naaman saw him and alighted from his chariot to meet him.</p><p>5. He asked if all was well; Gehazi lied, saying that his master had sent him to collect the gifts.</p><p>6. Naaman gave Gehazi twice his request and ordered his servants to assist him to carry the items home.</p><p>7. He put them on two of his servants to carry them for Gehazi.</p><p>8. When they came close home he collected the items from them and sent the men away.</p><p>9. He then hid them in his room.</p><p>10. Later, his master Elisha got to know the misdeed of his servant and questioned him, ‘Where have you been, Gehazi?”</p><p>11. Gehazi lied that he went nowhere.</p><p>12. His master said he was with him in spirit and he saw the things he collected from Naaman.</p><p>13. He, therefore, cursed him that the leprosy of Naaman would cleave to him, and his descendants forever.</p><p>14. And it was so/ he became leprous immediately, as a result of his greed.</p><p> </p><p>In the B part, points expected of candidates include;</p><p>1.

        "answer": "<p>(A) Jesus’ teaching on forgiveness (Matthew 18:21-35)<br>\nPoints expected of candidates are highlighted below;</p><p>1. Jesus told the story of the unmerciful servant in response to Peter’s question on how often one should show forgiveness to his/her neighbour.</p><p>2. Peter asked Jesus if it was seven times one should forgive one’s brother.</p><p>3. Jesus told him that one should forgive seventy times seven and not seven times.</p><p>4. To illustrate this, Jesus compared the Kingdom of heaven to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.</p><p>5. In the process, one of his debtors who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him to settle his debt.</p><p>6. As he could not pay his debt, the king ordered that he, his wife, children and all that he had be sold to settle the debt.</p><p>7. The debtor then fell on his knees and pleaded with the king to be patient so that he would settle the debt later.</p><p>8. Out of pity, the king released the man and forgave him the debt.</p><p>9. Interestingly, the same man who was forgiven his debt went out and found his fellow servant who owed him only a hundred denarii.</p><p>10. He grabbed him by his throat and demanded instant payment.</p><p>11. His fellow servant fell on his knees and pleaded for payment to be made later.</p><p>12. But the man refused the request and put his fellow servant in prison until the debt was settled.</p><p>13. When his fellow servants saw’ what had happened, they became distressed and reported the case to the king.</p><p>14. The king summoned the man and rebuked him for not showing mercy to the fellow servant who owed him.</p><p>15. In anger, the King handed the man over to the jailers until he had settled all his debt.</p><p>16. Jesus concluded that it is the same way that God would do to every one of us if we do not forgive our brother from our hearts/God would not forgive anyone who failed to forgive others.</p><p> </p><p>(B) State three lessons that can be learnt from Jesus’ teaching on forgiveness.</p><p>1. It builds trust and confidence among people.</p><p>2. It is a sign of maturity.</p><p>3. It elicits repentance/remorsefulness and confession.</p><p>4.

        "answer": "<p>(A) The trial of Jesus before Pilate as recorded by Luke’s gospel (Luke 23:1-12)</p><p>1. After Jesus had been found guilty of blasphemy for claiming to be the Christ a King, the Jewish Council brought him before Pilate.</p><p>2. The Sanhedrin had earlier passed the death sentence on him.</p><p>3. But the council had no legal right to execute the death sentence on Jesus without approval from the Romans.</p><p>4. The Sanhedrin was therefore required to send Jesus to Pontius Pilate, the Roman representative for trial.</p><p>5. And in order to make Jesus guilty before Pilate, they changed the charges levelled against him from religious blasphemy to political insurgence and revolution.</p><p>6. Jesus was accused of perverting the nation.</p><p>7. He was also charged with claiming to be a king.</p><p>8. Jesus was accused of forbidding the payment of taxes to Caesar.</p><p>9. Pilate asked Jesus if he was a King of the Jews, and Jesus answered in the affirmative.</p><p>10. Eventually, Pilate told the chief Priest and the crowd that Jesus was innocent by saying” I find no crime in this man”.</p><p>11. But the people said Jesus stirs up people, teaching throughout all Judea from Galilee.</p><p>12. When Pilate discovered that Jesus was a Galilean and belonged to Herod Antipas’ jurisdiction, he decided to send him to Herod Antipas.</p><p>13. After Herod had asked Jesus some questions at length and he did not answer, he mocked him and treated him with contempt.</p><p>14. Herod realised that Jesus was innocent even though his opponents accused him vehemently.</p><p>15. Finally, Herod returned Jesus to Pilate and on that day Pilate and Herod became friends as they were previously enemies.</p><p> </p><p>(B) Points expected of candidates are outlined below;</p><p>1.

        "answer": "<p>(A) The persecution of Peter and John after the healing of the lame man. (Acts 4: 1-31)</p><p>1. After the healing of the cripple at the Beautiful Gate, the lame man demonstrated his cure by leaping and praising God, as he accompanied the disciples into the temple.</p><p>2. Many people recognized the cured man and they were amazed.</p><p>3. As they gathered, Peter and John preached and about 5,000 were converted.</p><p>4. Peter attributed their ability to heal the man at the Beautiful Gate to the resurrected Christ.</p><p>5. There was so much noise in the temple that Peter and John were arrested by the Priests, the Sadducees and the captain of the temple.</p><p>6. They were put in custody and tried by the council the following day.</p><p>7. During the trial, they were asked to tell the source of the power they used to heal the cripple.</p><p>8. Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit answered that it was through the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom they crucified but God raised from the dead.</p><p>9. Peter also said that apart from Jesus, there was no other name by which men would be saved.</p><p>10. Peter added that Jesus is the stone which the builders rejected but has become the cornerstone.</p><p>11. The Sanhedrin upon seeing the boldness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were uneducated, common men, realized that they had been with Jesus.</p><p>12. The Council saw the man who had been healed standing with them and they could not press any charge against them.</p><p>13. The captain of the temple and the Sadducees who did not believe in the resurrection were annoyed because the disciples were proclaiming Jesus’ resurrection from death.</p><p>14. Thus the Sanhedrin decided to restrain Peter and John by commanding them not to speak in the name of Jesus again.</p><p>15. But Peter and John resolutely insisted that they would obey God rather than man.</p><p>16.

        "answer": "<p>(A) James’ advice to Christians to be doers of the word and not hearers only. (James 1:22-27, 2:14-26).<br>\nCandidates are expected to list out points such as;</p><p>1. James advised Christians to live according to the word of the Lord, which they have heard.</p><p>2. He said it would be of no use to hear the word and fail to put it into practice.</p><p>3. According to James, if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like someone who sees himself in a mirror and turns away and immediately forgets.</p><p>4. James says that, he who looks into the perfect law, and perseveres by doing it shall be blessed.</p><p>5. James is of the opinion that if one thinks he is religious but does not bridle his tongue, he deceives his heart and his religion is vain.</p><p>6. James holds the view that pure and undefiled religion before God entails visiting orphans and widows in their afflictions.</p><p>7. Pure religion also involves keeping oneself unstained from the world.</p><p>8. James says it is of no use to say you have faith but have no works to demonstrate the faith you have.</p><p>9. According to James, if someone is poorly clothed and hungry and you ask him to go in peace, and be warmed and filled without providing the clothing and food, then you are not backing your faith with works.</p><p>10. Hence, faith without works is dead/useless.</p><p>11. Abraham justified his faith by works when he was prepared to sacrifice his son, Isaac.</p><p>12. Abraham believed God and it was counted as righteousness and he was called a friend of God.</p><p>13. A person is therefore justified by works and not faith alone.</p><p>14. Similarly, Rahab the prostitute justified her faith by works when she received the messengers of Joshua and sent them out by another way..</p><p>15. James concludes by saying that, as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead.</p><p> </p><p>(B) Factors that hinder Christians from doing the will of God</p><p>1. Lack of faith/backsliding/unforgiving spirit</p><p>2. Unpleasant experiences</p><p>3. Desire to please the world/Materialism</p><p>4. Poverty</p><p>5. Fear</p><p>6.
