        "answer": "<p>(a) God ordered Abram to leave his father- land to go to the country that He would show him. Abram was promised by God that He (God) would raise his descendants into a great nation in that land. God said that He would bless him and curse those who curse him. All the peoples on earth will be blessed through him. Abram obeyed and left, according to the commandment of God, for Harran. He left with his wife, Lot and all their property. They headed towards Canaan. In Cannan, he moved towards Schechem and built an altar there. He moved further to Bethel and built another altar where he worshipped the Lord.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Four ways by which God calls people to His service nowadays are:</p><p>(I) Through dream.</p><p>(ii) Through vision.</p><p>(iii) Through accident</p><p>(iv) Through prophecy.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe Josiah's immediate response to the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple.</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways is the religious situation today similar to that of Josiah's time? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) When king Josiah was eighteen years old on the throne, he started his religious reforms. During the repair of the temple, a copy of the book was discovered by Hilkiah the high priest. Hilkiah gave the book to Shapan who read it and later read it to the king. When the king heard the content of the book of the law, he became sad and sent Hilkiah to go and find out from the Lord concerning the words of the book that had been found. The book contained the wrath of God which was looming on the people of Judah. Huldah, the prophetess was consulted. She said that Judah would suffer because the people had forsaken the Lord and worshipped baals. It was also prophesied that the king would be freed from this punishment, but the impending doom would happen to Judah after his reign. King Josiah cared the elders to the temple and read the book to them. Immediately, the king began to destroy the foreign cults and their practices. The vessels made for baals and Asherah were destroyed. He also destroyed all the houses built for male cult prostitutes which were built in the house of God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The religious situation of today is similar to that of Josiah's time in many ways among which are:</p><p>(i) Crimes and various vices are prevalent in our churches today.</p><p>(ii) There are many corrupt practices in our society (or churches) today.</p><p>(iii) As it was in Josiah's days when the people were filled with immoral acts, so also we have in our society today people we think to be practicing the religion, but instead are doing something else. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Discuss the experiences of Jonah in the belly of the fish and in Nineveh.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons did he learn from the experiences? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) After Jonah had been thrown into the sea, God chose a big fish to swallow him and Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days. Inside the fish, Jonah prayed to God for deliverance and the fish spewed him on to the dry land very close to Nineveh. After he had been delivered, God commanded him to go and proclaim His message to the people of Nineveh. He carried out the instruction of God and when the people of Nineveh heard his message, they believed and repented.</p><p>God forgave them because of their repentance and the city was spared from destruction. The action of God did not go down well with Jonah when he saw that God had forgiven the people. Jonah went to sit under a booth outside the city looking forward to God's destruction of the city. God appointed a plant and it came over him as a shade to save him from his discomfort and Jonah was very happy at this. His annoyance came again the second day when God caused the plant to die and the sun continued to beat upon his head. He requested that the best thing for him was to die. God told him that he was annoyed because of the plant he did not labour for, but wanted the city of Nineveh which had more than one hundred and twenty inhabitants to be destroyed.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Jonah had to learn some lessons from the experience. These include:</p><p>(i) God is omnipresent. It is not possible for anyone to run away from Him for He is everywhere.</p><p>(ii) We learnt from the story that God is merciful</p><p>(iii) We also learnt that God forgives those who repent of their sins.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the parable of the prodigal son.</p><p> </p><p>(b) State how the action of the father illustrates the nature of God. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Jesus told the parable of the prodigal son to his disciples. He said, a man had two sons. The younger of the two sons asked his father to give him his share of the property. The father consented to his request and divided his property into two and gave the boy his own share. The younger brother took what was given to him and went to a far country where he squandered his belongings. There after famine broke out in that city and the boy became wanting. He hired himself out to a land owner to look after his swines. He found it even difficult to eat, so he sought to eat out of the food given to the pigs but to no avail. He thought of his plight and wondered how many of his father's servants had enough bread to eat, while he was there perishing with hunger. At this point, he decided to go back to his father and beg him to take him as one of his labourers and not as a son. He finally left for home.</p><p>As he was approaching home, his father saw him far off. He had mercy on him, embraced him and kissed him. He commanded his servants to bath him , give him the best cloth and put a ring on his hand. He also directed that a fattened calf be killed to celebrate, for this son was dead and is alive again, he was lost and is found. His elder brother who was not at home when this took place came in later. He heard what was going on and enquired from one of the servants what was happening. He was told that his younger brother had come back and their father had killed a fatted calf for merry-making. For this reason, he was angry and he refused to go in. But when his father saw him, he begged him not to mind.</p><p>The son said for many years he had served his father, he had never disobeyed his command; still his father had never given him a kid that he might make merry with his friends, \"but this son of yours, who had squandered your property you had killed the most fattend calf for him\". His father replied him that he had always been with him and all he had was his.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The action of the father illustrates the nature of God in the following ways:</p><p>(i) God is always ready to forgive any sinner that repents of his sin, just like the father forgave his younger son.</p><p>(ii) Self - righteousness does not justify condemnation of sinners.</p><p>(iii) God's saving love is expended for both the sinners and the self-righteous.</p>",

        "question": "<p>How did Jesus explain to Martha and Thomas separately, that he is the resurrection and the life?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Before Jesus arrived Bethany, Lazarus had been buried for four days. Martha heard of Jesus' arrival and went to meet him. She told Jesus that if he (Jesus) had been around, his brother would not have died. She said that whatever Jesus asked of God, God would do it for him. Jesus replied that his brother (Lazarus) would rise again.</p><p>Martha said she knew that her brother would resurrect in the last days. It was at this point that Jesus said. \" I am the resurrection and the life\". He said that whoever believes in him, though he dies, yet shall live and whoever lives and believes in him shall never die. In another encounter, Jesus said to Thomas that in his father's house, there are many rooms and that if this were not so, he would not have said that he was going to prepare a place for them. After this, Jesus said that he would come again and take them to himself. He then said that they knew where he was going, but, Thomas replied that they did not, how then could they know the way. Jesus replied, \" I am the way and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the father, but by me </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the events that took place in Iconium and Lystra during the first missionary journery.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Explain the attitude of the Jews in both places</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul and Barnabas were forced to move to Iconium from Antioch of Pisidia because of the Jewish persecution. In Iconium, they preached to the people in the synagogue and there were many converts. Despite the many converts they made, the Jewish persecutors descended hard on them and they were forced to leave for Lystra where they continued their preaching. In Lystra, they met a man who had been a cripple from birth. When they saw that he had faith, Paul made him well. He started to walk for the rest of his life. The crowd was astonished at the miracle performed by Paul and Barnabas.</p><p>They decided to make sacrifices to them believing that they were gods incarnate. The apostles prevented them from carrying out their plan as it would amount to committing sin. The apostles tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, convincing them that they were not gods but men like them and that they needed no sacrifices. They told them that what they were doing was just to spread the good news concerning Jesus Christ which would turn them away from their ignorance of the worship of God. Still in Lystra, Paul drew the attention of the people to the freedom that God allowed them in the past. He told them how God sent His son (Jesus) to the world to bring salvation to the whole world.</p><p>However, Paul could not prevent the people from offering the sacrifices to them. At this point, the Jewish persecutors came and stirred the people against them. Paul was stoned and dragged out of the city. They thought he was dead. The new converts in Lystra gathered around him; when he had recovered, they secretly led him back into the city.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The attitudes.of the Jews, both in Iconium and Lystra could be said to be as follows:</p><p>(i) From Iconium and Lystra, the two cities that the apostles visited, the Jewish persecutors did not allow them to carry out their preaching as expected. The persecutors were after their lives. They stirred people against them, beat them, sent them away and prevented the people from hearing the word of God.</p><p>(ii) In Lystra, Paul was stoned to a state of coma. This shows the extent of opposition the apostles received, thereby preventing them from carrying out their preaching successfully. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe Paul's teaching on humility as contained in his letter to the Philippians. Indicate two ways by which a christian can manifest a life of humility.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) In Paul's letter to the Philippians, Paul urges the Christians to possess a sense of love, sharing in the spirit, affection and sympathy in order to complete the joy of being Christians by living in harmony with one another. The Christians are warned to desist from any act of selfishness and conceit but should show humility. This means they should put others first before themselves. They should imitate Jesus Christ whose humility should be a model for them. Jesus was in form of God, but did not equate himself with God. Instead, he humbled himself as a servant, up to the point of death. As a result of Jesus' humility, God highly exalted him both in heaven and on earth. Therefore, Jesus is Lord to the glory of the father. </p>",

        "question": "<p>In what ways, according to Paul, should Thessalonian christians prepare for the second coming of Christ? </p>",

The signs of the second coming shall be noticed by the archangel calling with the sound of trumpets. Then Jesus would appear in heaven. Those who have already died in the Lord would rise first, the living ones would join them together to meet the Lord in the mid-air. For this to take place, Paul told the Thessalonian Christians to get prepared for the D- day, for it would come unexpectedly like a thief in the night. He advised that there should be no confusion in the church concerning the second coming of Jesus.</p><p>They should not panic or be deceived by false prophecies about it and they should not be caught unawares. As children of moral uprightness, Christians should not allow themselves to be taken unprepared. They should be awake, sober, watchful and bearing in mind the faith, love and hope which are means of salvation. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) James advised Christians to live according to the word of Jesus which they have received as it would be useless to hear the word and fail to put it into use to give support to their faith. He continued to say that if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer , such a person can be likened to somebody who sees himself in a mirror and turns away immediately without further examination of himself. - Any person that accepts the word as taught by Jesus Christ and takes it with all seriousness will never forget the teaching of the law. Such person's relationship with people in the society will ever be guided by the law. If he acts according to the dictates of the law, he is joyful and happy.</p><p> </p><p>(b) A person that involves himself in slanderous remarks, lying, perjury and speaking indecent and abusive language is conducting himself irreligiously. What makes our religion spotless is our works of charity and justice</p>",
