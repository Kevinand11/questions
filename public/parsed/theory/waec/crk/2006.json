        "answer": "<p>(a) Eli, a priest at Shiloh, had two worthless sons. They committed acts of immorality with female worshippers at Shiloh and they also desecrated sacrifices offered to God. The report eventually came to Eli and prophesied doom on his family, but Eli did nothing more to stop the unholy act. A man of God also came to Eli and prophesied doom on his family.

        "answer": "<p>The circumstances that led to the dismissal of Gehazi are: Elisha healed Naaman, the leper, without a charge. Gehazi, Elisha's servant, regretted his master's refusal of Naaman's gifts and swore to collect a reward. So, he ran after Naaman who halted on sighting him. Gehazi lied to him that visitors came to him unexpectedly. He said Elisha requested a talent of silver and two festal garments, which Naaman quickly obliged and even begged to give two talents which his two servants conveyed for Gehazi. At the house, Gehazi took the items and sent the servants away secretly. When Elisha asked where he went, he denied going anywhere. Elisha asked if his spirit did not follow him and whether it was time for acquisition of wealth. He then ordered that Naaman's leprosy be transferred to Gehazi and his descendants for ever. Gehazi left Elisha's presence a leper, as white as snow.</p><p> </p><p>b) The lessons that can be learnt from Gehazi's conduct are:</p><p>(i) It is not good to be greedy or materialistic.</p><p>(ii) It is wrong to lie to cover an offence.</p><p>(iii) Elisha was a prophet; we should know the kind of people we deal with.</p><p>(iv) One can get diseases (e.g. AIDS) through secret deals/sinful acts.</p><p>(v)The consequences of sin can be generational.</p><p>(vi) God knows the secret sins of man. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) The circumstances that led to Jesus' declaration of Himself as the \"Bread of Life\" are: After feeding the 5000 men, Jesus took a boat and went to the other side of the sea. When the people came to Him, they asked him when he came there. Jesus knew that they were seeking Him, not because of his teachings, signs and wonders but because of food. He asked them not to labour for the ordinary bread that gives temporary satisfaction. That they should instead, labour for the bread that endures to eternal life. The crowd demanded to know what to do as a proof that they were doing the work of God. Jesus asked them to believe in Him as God-sent. For this they demanded signs to prove His messiahship, which would make them believe. Jesus then said, Moses gave their fathers manna from heaven and they believed in Him as God-sent. He explained that it was not Moses who gave their fathers manna from heaven but God Himself. He then assured that God can give them the bread that endures to eternal life. The people requested to be given the life-giving bread always, and Jesus then told them, \"I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger and he who believes in me shall never thirst.\"</p><p> </p><p>(b) The moral lessons in this story are that</p><p>(i) Christians should not base their belief only on signs.</p><p>(ii) Their beliefs should not be based on material possessions.</p><p>(iii) They should depend on Jesus as their source of life.</p><p>(iv) Being physically weak or hungry does not affect spiritual strength.</p><p>(v) Man should not live by bread alone but by the word Df God.</p><p>(vi) There is need to be cautious in giving people title because of what they offer. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(i) Sermon on the mount under worldly possession: Jesus taught His followers not to lay their treasures on earth where moth consumes and robbers steal. He admonished that they should lay their treasures in heaven where it would be safe. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. According to Jesus, the eye is the amp of the body. So, if the eye is sound, the whole body would be full of light. However, if the eye is not sound, the whole body would be full of darkness. If the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness? Jesus asked. No one can serve two masters, said Jesus: for either he would hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to th one and despise the other. According to Jesus, no one can serve God and Mammon.</p><p>(ii) Sermon on the mount under Anxiety: Jesus taught that people should not be anxious about their life; what the shall eat or drink. Or about their body; what they shall put on. According to Jesus, life is more than food and th body more than clothing. He also said that birds neither sow nor reap or gather, but are fed by God. According t Jesus, human beings are of more value than birds. He asked if by being anxious one can add a cubit to his stature, He wondered why people should be anxious about clothing. The lilies do not toil or spin, but according to Jesus they are better arrayed than Solomon. Jesus said God who clothed the grass will clothe the people and admonishes that they should have more faith as he tagged them, men of little faith. Jesus then asked them to seek first God': kingdom and His righteousness and all other things shall be added.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The lessons that can be learnt from the teachings are that:</p><p>(i) One should not be too conscious of world!: possessions.</p><p>(ii) Christians should seek the kingdom of God all the time.</p><p>(iii) God is the greatest provider.</p><p>(iv) WE should not be too anxious of what to eat or drink.</p><p>(v) We should serve God alone with all our hearts.</p><p>(vi) God care: for us all and knows our needs.</p><p>(vii) Anxiety does not solve problems.</p>",

Since the place of Judas Iscariot in the ministry had become vacant, there was the need to replace him. The person to replace him must be somebody who had witnessed with Jesus from the time of His baptism to His death and resurrection. Joseph Barsabas and Matthias who fitted the description were nominated for the post. The congregation prayed to God to assist in making the choice. After the prayer, they cast lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias.

Paul told them that he had a right as a preacher to depend on them for maintenance, but had chosen to work in order to lay an example for them.

Paul also advised them as brethren not to be fed up in well-doing. However, he advised that anyone who refuses to obey the instructions in this letter, should be isolated.

        "question": "<p>(a) Explain James concept of works in relation to Faith.</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what three ways can Christians demonstrate their faith in their daily life?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) James' concept of works in relation to faith: To James, hearing the word is good but doing what is heard brings blessing to the doer. It is of no benefit to declare faith which is not matched by works. For James, faith is an abstract expression which, in concrete terms, is put in action by works. Practical response to the needs of brethren profits more than mere verbal expression of faith (\"Go in peace, be warmed and filled\"). James further said that one's work can prove one's faith. It is not enough to believe that God is one, for even demons believe and shudder.Abraham's faith was justified when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar. So, his faith was active along with his works and was completed by his works. By Abraham's action, James insists that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. That means that faith and works go together, one complementing the other. Rahab, the harlot, believed the spies were God's people. She treated them kindly for her own rescue and her works justified her faith. James thus declared: \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.\"</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways by which Christians should demonstrate their faith in their daily life:</p><p>(i) Christians should establish vocational/technical institutions for training of the unemployed.</p><p>(ii) They should obey those in government/authority.</p><p>(iii) They should ensure good governance by participating in government.</p><p>(iv) They should help the poor and needy.</p><p>(v) They should participate in Church activities.</p><p>(vi) They should establish orphanages/mental homes/vocations, etc.</p>",
