        "question": "<p>Describe the role of Zayd b. Thabit in the preservation of the Qur;ān.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>According to Islamic traditions, <strong>Zayd bin Thabit</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language\">Arabic</a>: زيد بن ثابت‎) was the personal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe\">scribe</a> of the Islamic prophet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad\">Muhammad</a>, and was from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_(Islam)\">ansar</a> (helpers). He joined the ranks of the Muslim army at age 19. After Muhammad's passing, he was ordered to collect the Quran into a single volume from various written and oral sources. He was a noted expert on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran\">Quran</a> and spent much time reciting it.</p><p>When Zayd was 6 years old his father died in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bu%27ath\">Battle of Bu'ath</a>. Zayd was 11 years old when he asked permission to participate in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr\">Battle of Badr</a>. Since he was younger than 15 years old, Muhammad did not allow him to do so and sent him back. He then decided to try to win favour with Muhammad by learning the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran\">Quran</a>. He was later appointed to write letters to non-Muslims and to collect and keep a record of the Qur'anic verses. Zayd was among those chosen by Muhammad to write down the verses of the Quran. He used to spend most of his time reciting the Quran and continued to learn the Quranic verses as they were recited by Muhammad. Zayd later volunteered to fight when he was 19 years old. This time he was accepted in the ranks of the Muslim army. Zayd's time to fight had come nine years after the establishment of the Muslim community in Medina.</p><p>Zayd had the role of writing down the Quranic verses that Muslims believe were sent to Muhammad from Allah through the Angel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit_(Islam)\">Jibrail</a>.</p><p>After Muhammad's death, Zayd, who by this time had become an expert in the Quran, was assigned the role of authenticating and collecting the oral and textual Quranic revelation into a single bounded volume. This initiative was high on the Caliph <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr\">Abu Bakr</a>'s agenda, especially after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridda_wars\">Ridda wars</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yamamah\">Battle of Yamamah</a> in particular, in which a large number of Quran memorizers perished. Umar convinced Abu Bakr that the Quran should be collected in one manuscript. During Abu Bakr's reign as caliph, he was given the task of collecting the Quranic verses from all over the Muslim communities. Zayd finally accepted the task and, according to him, started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men. When Zayd had completed his task, he left the prepared sheets with Abu Bakr. Before he died, Abu Bakr left the sheets with Umar who in turn left it with his daughter Hafsah. Hafsah, Umm Salamah and Aishah were wives of Muhammad who memorized the Quran.</p><p>Zayd ibn Thabit thus became one of the foremost authorities on the Quran. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_ibn_al-Khattab\">Umar ibn al-Khattab</a> once addressed the Muslims and said: \"O people, whoever wants to ask about the Quran, let him go to Zayd ibn Thabit.\"</p>",

        "question": "<p>Examine the activities of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) in the first two years of his stay in Yathrib.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>On September 24, 622, the prophet Muhammad completes his <em>Hegira,</em> or “flight,” from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution. In Medina, Muhammad set about building the followers of his religion—<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/religion/islam\">Islam</a>—into an organized community and Arabian power. The Hegira would later mark the beginning (year 1) of the Muslim calendar.</p><p>Muhammad, one of the most influential religious and political leaders in history, was born in Mecca around 570. His father died before he was born, and Muhammad was put under the care of his grandfather, head of the prestigious Hashim clan. His mother died when he was six, and his grandfather when he was eight, leaving him under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new head of the clan. When he was 25, Muhammad married a wealthy widow 15 years his senior. He lived the next 15 years as a merchant, and his wife gave birth to six children: two sons, who died in childhood, and four daughters.</p><p>From time to time, Muhammad spent nights in a cave in Mount Hira north of Mecca, ruminating on the social ills of the city. Around 610, he had a vision in the cave in which he heard the voice of a majestic being, later identified as the angel Gabriel, say to him, “You are the Messenger of God.” Thus began a lifetime of religious revelations, which he and others collected as the Qur’an, or Koran. Muhammad regarded himself as the last prophet of the Judaic-Christian tradition, and he adopted aspects of these older religions’ theologies while introducing new doctrines. Muhammad’s monotheistic religion came to be called <em>Islam,</em> meaning “surrender [to God],” and its followers were <em>Muslims,</em> meaning “those who have surrendered.” His inspired teachings would bring unity to the Arabian peninsula, an event that had sweeping consequences for the rest of the world.</p><p> </p><p>By 615, Muhammad had gained about 100 converts in Mecca. He spoke out against rich merchants, who he criticized as immoral in their greed, and he denounced the worshipping of idols and multiple gods, saying, “There is no god but God.” City leaders became hostile to him, and in 619 his uncle Abu Talib died and was succeeded as head of the Hashim clan by another one of Muhammad’s uncles, Abu Lahib. Abu Lahib refused to protect Muhammad, and persecution of the prophet and his Muslims increased.</p><p>In the summer of 621, an entourage of 12 men came to Mecca from Medina, an oasis community 200 miles to the north. They were ostensibly making a pilgrimage to Mecca’s pagan shrines, but they had actually come to meet with Muhammad and profess themselves as Muslims. In 622, a larger group of converts from Medina came to Mecca and took an oath to Muhammad to defend him as their own kin. Muhammad immediately encouraged his Meccan followers to make their way to Medina in small groups. When city authorities learned that the Muslims had begun an exodus, they plotted to have the prophet killed. Under this threat, Muhammad slipped away unnoticed with a chief disciple and made his way to Medina, using unfrequented paths. He completed the celebrated Hegira (<em>Hijrah</em> in uncorrupted Arabic) on September 24, 622. The history of Islam had begun.</p><p>At Medina, Muhammad built a theocratic state and led raids on trading caravans from Mecca. Attempts by Meccan armies to defeat the Muslim forces failed, and several leading Meccans immigrated to Medina and became Muslims. Muhammad later become more conciliatory to Mecca, and in 629 he was allowed to lead a pilgrimage there in exchange for a peace treaty. Shortly after, he was attacked by allies of the Meccans, and Muhammad denounced the treaty. In January 630, he returned to his birthplace with 10,000 men, and the Meccans swore allegiance to its Muslim conquerors. He was now the strongest man in Arabia. During the next few years, most of the peninsula’s disparate Arab tribes came to him to ask for alliance and to convert to his religion. By his death, on June 8, 632, Muhammad was the effective ruler of most of Arabia, and his rapidly growing empire was poised for expansion into Syria and Iraq.</p><p> </p><p>Within 20 years, the Byzantine and Persian empires had fallen to the prophet’s successors, and during the next two centuries vast Arab conquests continued. The Islamic empire grew into one of the largest the world has ever seen, stretching from India, across the Middle East and Africa, and up through Western Europe’s Iberian peninsula. The spread of Islam continued after the fragmentation of the Arab empire, and many societies in Africa and Asia voluntarily adopted Muhammad’s religion. Today, Islam is the world’s second-largest religion.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Analyse the lessons contained in Sūratul-Fātiḥah.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>When we examine these verses, we find that it has some very interesting qualities that make it a unique prayer. In a short examination of the above verses, especially the section we have highlighted, we will find guidance on:</p><ol>\n<li>Having humility as a servant of Allah <em>subhanahu wa ta’ala</em> (Glorified is He) in the community</li>\n<li>Ascribing success to Allah (swt) and not to oneself</li>\n<li>The comprehensiveness of Islam</li>\n<li>The social nature of the Islamic message</li>\n</ol><p>As we explore the garden of <em>Surah Fatihah</em>, we will pick these four fruits.</p><p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Humility</strong></p><p>In this prayer which Allah (swt) revealed to us, it is clear that we are to ask for guidance upon the Straight Way. However, the nature of this path, its location, its signs, its characteristics, and its direction are all left out. We are given no indication as to how to get there, how to find the map for it. Instead, the path is described in one single way: “The Path of Those Whom You Have Favored”.</p><p>It is interesting that rather than pointing to concepts or ideas for the individual to discover on one’s own, Allah (swt) pointed to people. He tells us that this path is found with those whom His favor is upon. What is the point of doing this?</p><p>It has immediately turned us into students. We are seeking this path and when Allah (swt) points to the people whom He has favored, our minds become fixed on seeking out these people. Who are they? How can we be like them? How can we join their company? Rather than allowing us to feel arrogant that we are on the Straight Path, we have been directed towards others who may already be there. But again…who are they?</p><p><strong>“All who obey Allah and the Messenger</strong> <strong>are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah, – of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!” (Qur’an <a href=\"https://quran.com/4/69\">4:69</a>)</strong></p><p>And here we have:</p><p>-How to join this company: Obey Allah and the Messenger ﷺ (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).</p><p>-Who the company consists of: the Prophets, the <em>Siddiqeen</em> (the truthful sincere servants of God), the <em>Shuhadaa</em> (those who testify to the Truth with their speech, and if needed will defend the Truth and the innocent with their lives), and the <em>Saliheen</em> (those who are righteous in actions).</p><p>Allah (swt), then praises this group by calling it a beautiful fellowship.</p><p>By naming these four groups of people in the Qur’an as those whom the Grace of Allah is upon, He has pointed us not to a set of concepts, but to a community and a set of examples. From the teachings of the Prophets we take knowledge and the framework of Truth for all that follows. From the <em>Siddiqin</em> we derive the lessons and examples of sincere worship. From the <em>Shuhada </em>we see examples of those who act and struggle to testify to Truth. And from the<em> Saliheen</em> we see examples of righteous actions. So the one aiming for the Straight Path should seek out these people, their company, their examples, and learn from what they have.</p><p>This teaches the servant that he should think himself self-reliant in his journey towards God’s grace, but should remember that there are those in the past, and those in the community that he can seek out and be in good company with.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Ascribing Success to Allah</strong></p><p>In mentioning the Straight Path, Allah (swt) does not simply provide a list of actions. Rather, He makes it clear that He is the One acting.</p><p>أَنْعَمْتَ – This word means “You bestow <em>nai’mah</em> (favor) upon” in reference to God. A subtle reminder that we are not the one’s who “earn” Allah’s grace, but that He gives it to us out of His mercy. Though we can attract his Mercy through sincerity, Allah (swt) is reminding us that it is not our deeds alone that bring guidance or forgiveness, but it is something that He bestows upon us as a Favor, a <em>nai’mah</em>. This again reminds the servant to be humble before Allah (swt).</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>The Comprehensiveness of Islam</strong></p><p>Every group, methodology, and ideology will have some method or idea which it sees as the primary driver of Islamic reform for the individual and the community. Some groups oriented around <em>Tasawwuf</em> (self-improvement) will focus on spiritual purification. Others focused around societal change will focus on activism in the community – both social and political. Other organizations will focus on righteous deeds and worship. Yet others will focus on knowledge.</p><p>However we see that when Allah (swt) describes the people who have His Grace, they represent ALL of these various interests and agendas. They are according to Qur’an, <a href=\"https://quran.com/4/69\">4:69</a>:</p><p><strong>–<em>Nabiyeen</em>/Prophets:</strong> The bearers of the Message of God, the deliverers of <strong>Knowledge</strong> from God to humanity, and the providers of the religious foundation for generation to come and all the groups that follow below.</p><p><strong>–<em>Siddiqeen</em>/the Sincere and Truthful:</strong> Those whose <strong>hearts are purified</strong> and are sincere in their reverence for God and in their actions amongst people. Truthfulness emanates not only in their speech but in their actions, because their intentions are pure and for God alone.</p><p><strong>–<em>Shuhadaa</em>/Witnesses: </strong>Those who <strong>actively strive</strong> to witness to the Truth under extraordinary circumstances, whether under threat of loss of life or wealth. They testify to Islam and call to goodness and benefit and may eventually find themselves giving all they have in order to defend innocent people and protect the lives of others.</p><p><strong>–<em>Saliheen</em>/the Righteous: </strong>Those who dedicate extraordinary amounts of time to the doing of good deeds. Prayer, fasting, giving charity, visiting the sick, helping the orphan, remembering the name of God, reciting the Qur’an, and doing their utmost to have their limbs always in the worship of the Creator and in the service of His Creation.</p><p>It is amazing that in describing the people of the Straight path, the Qur’an mentions all of the various goals and methods – the seeking of knowledge, the purification of the soul, activism, and the doing of good deeds. Yet another testament to the fact that Islam is comprehensive, and calls for balance in the various priorities on the Straight path.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><strong>The Social Nature of the Islamic Message</strong></p><p>By highlighting a set of people, instead of a list of to-dos, the Qur’an has pointed us towards a religion that is not individualistic, but is based around being part of a community. It is asking us to seek out people from whom we can learn, and good company with whom we can be.</p><p>As the Prophet ﷺ said, “A person is upon the religion of his/her friends.” The most intimate companions of a person will often affect his/her faith and will influence the direction of his/her life.  But if we know that we should seeking the knowledge and stay within the framework provided by the Prophet ﷺ, strive to be with people who show purity and sincerity as best as we can notice, spend time in circles of activism and call to good things, and work hard to do righteous actions and be in groups that do righteous actions, the Qur’an is telling us that while in that company, we are on the Straight Path – <em>insha’Allah </em>(God-willing).</p>",

        "answer": "<p>According to traditional Islamic beliefs, the Quran was revealed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad\">Muhammad</a>, a trader in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz\">western Arabian</a> city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca\">Mecca</a> founded by the prophet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_in_Islam\">Ismail</a>, which had become a sanctuary for pagan deities and an important trading center. The revelations started one night during the month of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan\">Ramadan</a> in 610, when Muhammad, at the age of forty, received the first visit from the angel Gabriel.</p><p>The Quran uses the term <em>ummi</em> to describe Muhammad. The majority of Muslim scholars interpret this word as a reference to an illiterate individual, though some modern scholars instead interpret it as a reference to those who belong to a community without a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book\">scripture</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-6\">[6]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></p><p>According to the famous collector of traditions of Muhammad, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari\">Muhammad al-Bukhari</a> (who lived about 250 years after Muhammad), Muhammad's wife <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadija_bint_Khuwaylid\">Khadija bint Khuwaylid</a> described that the first Quranic revelation occurred when the angel Gabriel visited Muhammad and asked him to recite. Muhammad responded <em>ma ana bīqāre'u</em>, which could be translated into a number of ways: 'I do not read' or 'what am I to read/recite?' or 'I will not read/recite'. Gabriel pressed him \"until all the strength went out of me; thereupon he released me and said: 'Read!'\" This was repeated three times and upon the third, Gabriel released him and said, \"Read in the name of the Sustainer who created humankind from a clot! Read! And your Sustainer is the most Beautiful.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-The_Quran:_A_User's_Guide-8\">[8]</a>:39–41 After this Muhammad continued to have revelations sporadically over a period of twenty-three years, until shortly before his death in 11/632.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-The_Quran:_A_User's_Guide-8\">[8]</a>:45</p><p>Muslims believe that Gabriel brought the word of God to Muhammad verbatim, and the Quran was divinely protected from any alteration or change. The Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text and that he had no authority to change it. It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed.</p><p>According to tradition, Muhammad described the experience of revelation:</p><blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell. This form of inspiration is the hardest of them all and then it passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.\"</em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-The_Quran:_A_User's_Guide-8\">[8]</a>:43</p>\n</blockquote><p>At times, it was also reported that the experience was painful for Muhammad. For example, he had been heard saying, \"Never once did I receive a revelation without thinking that my soul had been torn away from me.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-The_Quran:_A_User's_Guide-8\">[8]</a>:43</p><p>After Muhammad would receive revelations, he would later recite it to his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahabah\">companions</a>, who also memorized it or wrote it down. Before the Quran was commonly available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching it to others. The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practised among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in Arabic. This fact, taken in the context of 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest.</p><p>Non-Muslim people questioned the nature and modes of Muhammad's revelations. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccan\">Meccans</a> interpreted the Quranic revelations based on their understanding of 'inspiration'. For them, poetry was closely connected to inspiration from a higher spiritual source. For this reason when Muhammad began preaching and reciting the Quran, the Meccans accused him of being a poet or a \"poet possessed\".</p><p>Due to the fact that the Quran was revealed in disjointed verses and chapters, a point came when it needed to be gathered into a coherent whole text. There are disagreements among both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars as to when the Quran was first compiled. A hadith in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahih_al-Bukhari\">Sahih al-Bukhari</a> states that the caliph Abu Bakr commanded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Thabit\">Zayd ibn Thabit</a> to compile the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%27haf\">written Quran</a>, relying upon both textual fragments and the memories of those who had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafiz_(Quran)\">memorized</a> it.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-14\">[14]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Quran#cite_note-15\">[15]</a> Some Shia Muslims believe that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib\">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> was the first to compile the Quran into one written text, a task completed shortly after the death of Muhammad.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Describe the political life of pre-Islamic Arabs</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The most remarkable feature of the political life of Arabia before Islam was the total absence ofpolitical organization in any form. With the exception of Yemen in the south- west, no part of the Arabian Peninsula had any government at any time, and the Arabs never acknowledged anyauthority other than the authority of the chiefs of their tribes.The authority of the tribal chiefs, however, rested, in most cases, on their character andpersonality, and was moral rather than political.The modern student of history finds it incredible that the Arabs lived, generation after generation,century after century, without a government of any kind. Since there was no government, there wasno law and no order.The only law of the land was lawlessness. In the event a crime was committed, the injured party</p><p>took law in its own hands, and tried to administer “justice” to the offender. This system led very</p><p>frequently to acts of horrendous cruelty.Since there were no such things as police, courts or judges, the only protection a man could findfrom his enemies, was in his own tribe. The tribe had an obligation to protect its members even if</p><p>they had committed crimes. Tribalism or ‘asabiyya (the clan spirit) took precedence over ethics. A tribe that failed to protect its members from their enemies, exposed itself to ridicule, obloquy andcontempt. Ethics, of course, did not enter the picture anywhere.Since Arabia did not have a government, and since the Arabs were anarchists by instinct, they werelocked up in ceaseless warfare. War was a permanent institution of the Arabian society. The desertcould support only a limited number of people, and the state of intertribal war maintained a rigidcontrol over the growth of population. But the Arabs themselves did not see war in this light.To them, war was a pastime or rather a dangerous sport, or a species of tribal drama, waged by professionals, according to old and gallant codes, while the “audience” cheered. Eternal peace held no appeal for them, and war provided an escape from drudgery and from the monotony of life in the desert.</p><p> </p>",

        "question": "<p>Write on the significance of the first pillar of Islam.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The most important Muslim practices are the Five Pillars of Islam.</p><p>The Five Pillars of Islam are the five obligations that every Muslim must satisfy in order to live a good and responsible life according to Islam.</p><p>The Five Pillars consist of:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/shahadah.shtml\">Shahadah</a>: sincerely reciting the Muslim profession of faith</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/salat.shtml\">Salat</a>: performing ritual prayers in the proper way five times each day</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/zakat.shtml\">Zakat</a>: paying an alms (or charity) tax to benefit the poor and the needy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/sawm.shtml\">Sawm</a>: fasting during the month of Ramadan</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/hajj_1.shtml\">Hajj</a>: pilgrimage to Mecca</li>\n</ul><h3>Why are they important?</h3><p>Carrying out these obligations provides the framework of a Muslim's life, and weaves their everyday activities and their beliefs into a single cloth of religious devotion.</p><p>No matter how sincerely a person may believe, Islam regards it as pointless to live life without putting that faith into action and practice.</p><p>Carrying out the Five Pillars demonstrates that the Muslim is putting their faith first, and not just trying to fit it in around their secular lives.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Describe how Ḥajj is performed.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>There are three forms of Hajj: <em>Tamattu</em>,<em> Ifraad</em> and <em>Qiran</em>. For the purpose of this Hajj guide, we will use the <strong><em>Tamattu </em>form of Hajj</strong>, which is what the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) encouraged his followers to perform.</p><p>Before you arrive at Makkah to start Hajj, it’s important to make your intention (<em>niyah</em>) within your heart. The intention must be to perform the Hajj for the sake of Allah alone, with a desire for the Hereafter. It should not be done with the intention of being seen among others or for worldly gain.</p><p>Next, you’ll enter into the state of <em>ihram</em> (ritual purity). For men, this means wearing the designated white cloth with one piece wrapped around your shoulder and one around your waist. Ladies can wear any clothing of their choice but should ensure they observe the rules of hijab. Face coverings, however, are not permitted. Fully-covering shoes are also not permitted. Footwear must be in the form of sandals for both men and women.</p><p><em>In Ihram designated white cloth</em></p><p>Ihram is the spiritual state you enter once you have made the intention to go to Hajj. When over three million pilgrims descend into Makkah, there should not be any outwardly distinction between pilgrims. Everyone stands equal in the eyes of Allah (SWT), whether you’re rich or poor and irrespective of ethnicity. Hence, the rules around the clothing of Ihram are extremely simple, yet strict and <em>must</em> be adhered to.</p><p>Throughout these holy days, we should also be particularly mindful of our behaviour and words. We should avoid smoking, engaging in sexual relations, swearing, shaving our hair and cutting our nails. We must also not use perfume or scented soaps.</p><p>Once you arrive at the holy Masjid al-Haram, in Makkah, you’re then ready to start the biggest spiritual journey of your life!</p><blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Carry a spare set of ihram if you can. As for sandals, I recommend investing in a decent pair of trekking sandals. They tend to be the most comfortable and practical, given that you will be walking long distances on tarmac as well as gravel. Try to get used to your sandals before you depart for Saudi so that you don’t break out in blisters or face discomfort once there.</p>\n</blockquote>",
