        "question": "<p>Highlight the preservation of the Qur;an in the early days of Islam.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>According to the Muslim understanding, the Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad  over 23 years, from the age of 40 to his death at the age of 63. Over those 23 years, he received the revelation from God in a number of ways. Most commonly, it was spoken to him directly by the Angel Gabriel, but at other times it came during his dreams, and on a number of occasions, it even came to him directly from God, and he experienced this as the sound of a heavy bell, after which the words of the revelation were made clear to him.</p><p>Throughout those 23 years, the Prophet  endeavoured to share the revelation with those around him as soon as it came. He did this verbally, as he couldn’t read or write, but he strongly encouraged others around him to write down the revelation, as well as memorise it. This was the basis of how Muslims believe the Qur’an became preserved, not purely through written or oral means, but with both strengthening the other. The companions around him constantly strove to memorise the verses, with many eventually memorising the entire book, and simultaneously wrote these verses on parchment, bone, wood, stone, basically whatever they had around them. Over time at least 65 companions functioned as scribes for the Prophet , who eventually established a school in Madinah dedicated to teaching 900 of his companions to read and write.</p><p>However, the dialect of the Quraishi tribe that the Prophet  spoke in was not the only dialect of the Arabian peninsula, and as the religion was adopted by a growing number of tribes, they began to struggle with understanding the Qur’an. To overcome this, the Prophet  was given permission to teach the Qur’an in 7 of the main dialects in the region, allowing the message to be understood more widely. These dialects didn’t affect the written records, as they were only different when the Qur’an was actually vocalised.</p><p>This was the state of the Qur’an at the death of the Prophet . Hundreds of companions who had memorised the complete Qur’an in 7 official dialects, all of which were considered valid ways of reciting the Qur’an, as well as an incredible amount of written records that were held by the Prophets companions throughout Madinah and beyond. The placing of each verse within each chapter had been established by the Prophet , but because each chapter functions as an independent unit, the companions had different ways of ordering the chapters themselves within the book as a whole.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Outline the lessons in the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s (S.A.W.) Farewell Sermon.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The month of Zhul Hijja is a special month. It is the month of Hajj. Just as the last ten nights of Ramadan are the best nights of the year, so are the first ten days of Zhul Hijjah. In fact, they are the best ten days of the year filled with immense blessings. One should increase his/her acts of worship (<em>ibadat</em>) through fasting, charity, zikr, additional prayers, supplications, and of course, <em>udhiyah</em> or animal sacrifice, a tradition commemorating the legacy of Ibrahim (AS) for his willingness to sacrifice his son Ismael. This occasion occurs on the tenth day of Zhul Hijjah.<br>\n<br>\nIn the tenth year after migration to al-Madinah (hijirah), Muhammad (SAW) performed his only hajj along with thousands of companions. The journey of hajj was indeed a significant event. The Prophet (SAW) established the rites of Hajj, an important mode of worship incumbent upon every able Muslim once in his/her lifetime. Additionally, according to some scholars, it is believed that on the ninth day, the day of Arafat, he (SAW) received the last revelation, <em>“This day, I have perfected for you your religion (deen), completed my favor upon you and am pleased with Islam as your deen (way of life).” </em>(al-Ma’idah, 5:3)<br>\n<br>\nThe companions rejoiced. However, upon hearing the ayah, Omar (RAA) cried. The Prophet (SAW) asked, “What makes you cry O’ Omar?” “Although nothing is perfect, our deen is perfect now and I fear that with time it is going to deteriorate,” Omar replied. The Prophet (SAW) agreed and said, “You have spoken the truth.” He (SAW) then said, “Islam began as something strange, and shall return to being strange as it began, so blessed are the strangers.”<br>\n<br>\nIndeed, the same <em>jahili</em> practices that were prevalent before Islam such as tribal wars, bloodshed, intoxication, music, adultery and fornication, interest and usury, etc. can be seen today everywhere in the world and just as Islam was conceived to be strange back then, the same teachings today are considered to be strange. Therefore, blessed are strangers who adhere to the deen dearly while sharing its message with others.<br>\n<br>\nThroughout the journey of hajj, the Prophet (SAW) would admonish and advise his people. His speeches were collected in what is commonly known as “The Prophet’s Farewell Sermon” or <em>Hajjatul Wada’. </em>The sermon highlighted the most significant teachings of his prophetic mission of twenty-three years. Such pearls of wisdom have been etched in the books and minds of many Muslims for all time to come. It was, among others things, a document of human rights.<br>\n<br>\nAfter praising and thanking Allah (SWT), the Prophet (SAW) said, “O people! Lend me an attentive ear. For I know not whether after this year I shall ever be among you. Therefore, listen to what I am saying very carefully and take these words to those who are not present here today.” Months after he delivered the sermon, the Prophet (SAW) returned back to His Lord leaving behind a great legacy.<br>\n<br>\nThe Prophet’s speech began with a word of caution. He addressed the sanctity of human lives. He (SAW) reminds, “O people! Just as you regard this month, this day, this city as sacred so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will meet your Lord and that He will indeed reckon your deeds.”<br>\n<br>\nThe Prophet (SAW) took advantage of the most blessed and sacred day of Arafat in the sacred month of Hajj, in the most sacred place in the world, Makkah to make a point. Bloodshed is forbidden due to the sanctity of human life. In addition to human life, people’s properties are also sacred. In a hadith the prophet insisted, “The blood, wealth and honor of the Muslim are sacred to all Muslims.” He (SAW) stressed, “The destruction of the world in the sight of Allah is lighter than the killing of one Muslim man.”<br>\n<br>\nThe Qur’an is very clear on this subject as many passages address the sanctity of human lives. In one place Allah emphatically stresses this point, <em>“And do not take any human being’s life – (the life) which God has willed to be sacred – except through (due process of) law.”</em> (17:33) The Qur’an clearly states that whoever kills an innocent soul has committed an act akin to murdering all of humanity. <em>“If anyone kills a person; unless in retribution for murder or spreading corruption in the land, it is as if he kills all mankind, while if any saves a life it is as if he saves the lives of all mankind” (al-Ma’idah,5:32)</em><em>.</em><br>\n<br>\nThe US declaration of “War on Terrorism” has left millions dead. The imperial wars succeeded in dividing Muslims creating a rift between Muslim nation states sowing the seed of discord and disunity. Muslims killing other Muslims, complete destruction of cities and towns, people leaving their homes and properties to be plundered and looted by gangs that allege to be good Muslims - apparently the teachings of the Prophet (SAW) have fallen on deaf ears.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to the sanctity of human lives, the Prophet mentioned the sanctity of properties, “Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners.” This statement echoes Allah’s mandate, <em>“Allah commands you to return the trusts to their rightful owners.”</em> (an-Nisa’, 4:58) One of the main qualities of a true believer is that they safeguard their trusts and fulfill their promises.<br>\n<br>\nMuslims who have betrayed any trust, big or small, to any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, must settle it before meeting his/her Lord. Those who don’t will have a difficult time on the Day of Judgment as such matters will be settled by Allah (SWT) on the grand day of accountability, <em>“And He is the Best of Judges.”</em> (al-An’am, 6:57) The Prophet (SAW) made it very clear, “Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will meet your Lord and that He will indeed reckon your deeds.”<br>\n<br>\nIn his sermon, the Prophet (SAW) touched upon something of great importance, the subject of interest and usury (<em>riba</em>). Riba was introduced in Arabia by the Jews who lived there. The practice of <em>riba</em> is so abhorrent that even the polytheists (<em>mushriks</em>) of Quraish would not accept a penny earned from interest when rebuilding the Ka’bah. Originally the Ka’bah extended to the extremities of Hijr of Ismail (semi-circle). However, due to shortage of funds, they built the Ka’bah into the cube as it is known today. The polytheists of Makkah recognized the filth of <em>riba</em> and knew very well its negative implications and how such a practice could invite the wrath of God.<br>\n<br>\nThe Prophet (SAW) in his farewell sermon cautioned, “Allah has forbidden you to take usury (interest). Therefore, all interest obligations shall henceforth be waived. Your capital is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has judged that there shall be no <em>riba </em>and that all interest due to Abbass Bin Abdul Muttalib be waived.”<br>\n<br>\nThe entire world economic system is based on interest (<em>riba</em>). This practice strengthens some countries and weakens others. It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, thus widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. This is purely contrary to the teachings of Islam. Fair distribution of wealth based on fair dealing and equity is the spirit of Islamic economics. The main principal clause in the Islamic economic system is “S<em>o that it (wealth) does not circulate between the rich among you.” (al-Hashr, 59:7)</em><br>\n </p>",

This doesn’t mean just saying it, rather it means saying it with full meaning, therefore fulfilling its conditions</li>\n<li>The conditions of of “la ilaaha illa Allah” are:\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge in what you are saying.

[Al-Hujurat:15]</li>\n<li>Following him by acting upon whatever he has come with from the truth and abandoning whatever he has prohibited from falsehood.

And that cannot occur, except by acting upon the two of them and loving them more than one loves himself. [Al-Fat-h:8,9]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The testimony is an example of how the previous prophets (alayhim assalam) used to give da’wa, which is by negating all that is incorrect and then affirming what is correct. This can be seen as the testimony starts off with a negation “ worthy of worship”, which is followed by an affirmation “except Allah”</li>\n<li>A major deviation of the real purpose of the testimony is to say that everything is in the heart and actions are not needed</li>\n<li>Another major deviation is to concern ourselves with purification of the heart and ignoring everything else</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>The hadith says “establishing the prayer”, which is different to just “praying”</li>\n<li>In the Qur’an Allah refers to the believers as those who establish the prayer, but when He speaks about the ones who don’t pray properly, or don’t pray on time, He just refers to them as “the ones who pray” e.g. {Woe unto the ones who pray} [Al-Maa’oon, 107:4]</li>\n<li>Definitions of “establishing the prayer”:\n<ul>\n<li>Praying with the heart, soul, with awe and with khushoo’</li>\n<li>Bowing and prostrating, reciting of a complete manner, with full concentration and fear of Allah</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prayer is the best of deeds</li>\n<li>The effects of prayer on a person keeps him away from evil</li>\n<li>Ibn Al-Qayyim said prayer is of five degrees:\n<ul>\n<li>The one who is careless and is therefore punished</li>\n<li>The one who prays on time but at the same time he is distracted and is therefore admonished</li>\n<li>The one who fulfils his prayer by fighting the devil and is therefore redeemed</li>\n<li>The one who is entirely concerned with his prayer and is therefore rewarded</li>\n<li>The one who performs his prayer while only being preoccupied with Allah and is therefore rewarded and brought closer to Allah</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Abandoning the prayer takes someone out of the fold of this religion</li>\n<li>The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu ‘alayhi wasallam) was talking about obligatory prayers and he said, “<em>whoever abandons it purposely, then bari’at minhu al dhimma</em> (Islam is free from him)” (ibn Majah)</li>\n<li>The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu ‘alayhi wasallam) said:  “<em>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them is the prayer, and whoever neglects it has disbelieved </em>(become a kaafir).” (Ahmad)</li>\n<li>However, The Messenger of Allah (sallaAllahu ‘alayhi wasallam) also said: “<em>Whoever says la ilaaha illa Allah will enter jannah</em>” (ibn hibban)</li>\n<li>The above hadith seems to contradict the two hadiths mentioned before it, as the implied meaning of the hadith is that saying “la ilaaha illa Allah” is sufficient to admit someone into Jannah</li>\n<li>To understand the topic better, and remove the conflict, Scholars say:\n<ul>\n<li>Shahada is the key to jannah, and every key has its teeth.

        "question": "<p>Examine the conditions under which a Muslim is exempted from the fast of Ramadan.</p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>1. THE FIRST CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: ILLNESS</strong></p><p>Illness is any condition that takes a person outside the bounds of health as the result of some indisposition. Ibn Qudamah (d. 1223<em>ce</em>) said: “There is consensus among the scholars regarding the permissibility of breaking the fast due to illness in general, as stated in the verse of the Quran: Yet if one among you is sick or is on a journey, [such a person shall then fast] the same number of other days (Surat Al-Baqarah, 2:185).</p><p>The Companion (of the Prophet, on him be peace) Salamah ibn Al-Akwa‘ reported:</p><p>When the verse<em> “wa ‘ala’l-ladhîna uûthiqunahu</em>…”<em> /</em>  “Yet for those who are hardly able to endure it…” (Surat Al-Baqarah, 2:184) was revealed, those who wanted to break their fast were allowed to break their fast and pay the redemption, until the verse “<em>Shahru Ramadan alladhi</em>…”’ / “It was the month of Ramadan in which…” (Sûrat Al-Baqarah, 2:185) was revealed and abrogated the one before it.</p><p>So, the prescription to fast went through stages. First, God permitted the believers to break their fast. Then God obligated the fast unless one had a valid justification for not doing so.</p><p>Illness remained a valid reason for not fasting, though not any illness or pain legitimately excuses one from fasting. If one fears that fasting will worsen the sickness, delay its cure, or cause damage to anything in the body, then one has a valid excuse for breaking the fast. In fact, one <em>should</em> break one’s fast under these circumstances, for the higher obligation is to keep oneself from becoming debilitated or, of course, from perishing.</p><p>If one is well, but feels the difficulty of fasting, this does not rise to the level of sufficient cause for breaking the fast. The exception here is the Hanafi legal school’s position that if one who is well believes it <em>very likely</em> the fast will cause him or her to fall ill, one can break the fast. If, however, the fear of illness is anxiety or apprehension of illness, more delusion or obsession than actuality, then it is not permissible to break fast.</p><p>The Malikis disagree with the Hanafis in this, holding that if the healthy person has no illness to begin with but merely harbors a fear that fasting will cause illness, then he or she is barred from breaking the fast because the fear of illness neither proves the likelihood of such an outcome, nor does it meet the standard of a sufficient legal proof authorizing action. If, however, one knows with great certainty that fasting will definitely cause real harm, he or she can break the fast. The distinction, then, is diagnosing the likely onset of real harm as a result of fasting as opposed to a difficulty caused by fasting, as difficulty in fasting is a wholly invalid justification.</p><p>Now, even though one who is ill ought to break the fast, it does not render his or her fast invalid if one chooses to complete the fast.</p><p><strong>THE SECOND CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: TRAVEL</strong></p><p><strong>A. Travel defined and delimited</strong></p><p>The kind of travel that allows one to break one’s fast must fulfill at least three conditions, and a fourth, according to all but the Hanafi juristic school:</p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>. DISTANCE:</strong> Enough for one to shorten the ritual prayer (about 50 miles, according to most scholars, but the norm, which is the better measure, is what is considered by people of the time and place a journey).</p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>. DURATION:</strong> The person in the state of travel or far from home does not have the intention of staying at that destination for more than three days. In this latter case, the person may be permitted to not fast during the travel (if they fulfill the requirements of distance, exceedance, and intentionality), but must resume the fast when they arrive at their destination of more than three days.</p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>. EXCEEDANCE:</strong> One must go beyond the limits of the city or town one is staying in. This means if one were to travel 50 miles but still be within his metropolitan or town area, it would not count as travel. The question of whether one’s metropolitan area remains as one’s town or home region should be taken seriously, such as Greater Chicago, for instance.</p><p><strong>4a</strong><strong> INTENTIONALITY:</strong> According to the majority of scholars, the person undertaking the journey must not be making it for unlawful reasons or to unlawful destinations, like a gambling trip to Las Vegas. This is because the allowance to break one’s fast is to make travel easy. If someone is undertaking an unlawful action, they are not included in the principle of creating ease for the traveler.</p><p><strong>THE THIRD CATEGORY OF VALID EXEMPTION: AGE</strong></p><p>There is consensus that it is permissible for the elderly not to fast.

        "question": "<p>Explain the conditions under which a Muslim woman may seek divorce.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Despite Muslim community perceptions that under Islamic laws women can only divorce with their husband’s consent or by means of community processes, there are in fact <em>multiple</em> options available by which Muslim women in Australia can secure a religious divorce. Derived from the primary religious texts of the Qur’an and <em>Sunnah</em> (sayings and teachings of Prophet Muhammad) and formulated by Muslim male jurists into religious rulings by the twelfth century (six centuries after the introduction of Islam), they have become codified in many contemporary Muslim countries through case law or legislation.</p><p>Men can initiate divorce through <em>talaq</em> — which is no-fault — and they do not need the wife’s consent. According to Muslim jurists, this form of divorce is extra-judicial, in that they do not need to declare it before a religious authority. In order to manage registration of marriages and divorces, however, most Muslim countries now require men divorcing through <em>talaq</em> to notify the court. </p><p>Women are able to initiate divorce through the process of <em>khul‘.</em> This is a form of no-fault divorce referred to in the Qur’an and <em>Sunnah</em> where the husband’s consent was not stated to be required. In these primary texts, the wife is granted the ability to divorce her husband for the simple reason of <em>incompatibility</em>, and there are records of women at the time of the Prophet who married and divorced numerous times. There are also reports of women who married the Prophet but then changed their mind on the wedding night and he granted them divorce without seeking cause.</p><p>Over time, however, the majority of Muslim male jurists determined that the husband’s consent was necessary, and most Muslim countries today still adopt these twelfth-century rulings. Interestingly, case law in Pakistan (1967) and legislation in Egypt (2000) returned to the Prophetic practice whereby the husband’s consent was not needed.</p><p>If the husband is at fault, women can also initiate a judicial divorce through <em>faskh</em>, <em>tafriq</em> or <em>ta‘liq</em> — whereby in Muslim countries they present their case and prove certain grounds before a court judge. Because this form of divorce does not require the husband’s consent, this is usually the main option women take when they are not successful with <em>khul‘</em>. Given there are no such courts in Australia, Muslim women seek out divorce through community processes involving imams.</p><p>Many imams or religious leaders in Australia prefer the husband to pronounce <em>talaq</em> or give their consent to a <em>khul‘</em>, so that they are not responsible for ending the marriage, but in extreme cases of domestic violence they will award women this form of divorce. However, as reported by the ABC in a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-18/abused-muslim-women-denied-right-to-divorce/9632772\">series of investigations across various religious communities in 2018</a>, a number of Muslim women experiencing domestic violence faced numerous challenges seeking religious divorce from imams. This was in part due to imams having narrow interpretations as to what constituted “domestic violence” and requiring meetings with both the husband and wife present in the same place.</p><p>In my research, as well as <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/books/iss-16-islamic-family-law-in-australia-electronic-book-text\">that of others</a>, imams and community leaders are becoming aware of the dangers presented to women experiencing domestic violence and are working with specialist services to make the religious divorce a safer process for women.</p><p>Another option for divorce is that women can specify in their marriage contract her right to divorce through <em>talaq at-tafwid</em>, whereby the husband grants his right of <em>talaq</em> to his wife through delegation so that she can initiate divorce without needing his consent. Contrary to common belief among many Muslims, he still maintains his right of <em>talaq</em>. Given the sensitive nature of mentioning divorce at the time of marriage, many Muslim women are discouraged by their families from including it in their contract for fear that they are seen as not committing to the marriage long-term. There is a long tradition of <a href=\"http://www.wluml.org/node/588\"><em>talaq at-tafwid </em></a>in countries such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, but it is largely unknown and not commonly practised in many other Muslim countries and communities, including in Australia.</p>",

        "question": "<p>State the factors that contributed to the success of the Prophet;s (S.A.W.) mission in Madinah</p>",
        "answer": "<p>A delegation from Medina, consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the entire community. There was fighting in Yathrib (Medina) mainly involving its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people\">Arab</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews\">Jewish</a> inhabitants for around a hundred years before 620.The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bu%27ath\">battle of Bu'ath</a> in which all the clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal conceptions of blood-feud and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye\">an eye for an eye</a> were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.</p><p>Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina until virtually all of his followers had left <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca\">Mecca</a>. Being alarmed at the departure of Muslims, according to the tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate him. He instructed his cousin and future son-in-law <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali\">Ali</a> to sleep in his bed to trick the assassins that he had stayed (and to fight them off in his stead) and secretly slipped away from the town. By 622, Muhammad had emigrated to Medina, then known as Yathrib, a large agricultural <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis\">oasis</a>. Following the emigration, the Meccans seized the properties of the Muslim emigrants in Mecca.</p><p><br>\nThe first group of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism\">pagan</a> converts to Islam in Medina were the clans who had not produced great leaders for themselves but had suffered from warlike leaders from other clans. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_mythology\">pagan population</a> of Medina, apart from some exceptions. This was, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq\">Ibn Ishaq</a>, influenced by the conversion to Islam of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%27d_ibn_Mua%27dh\">Sa'd ibn Mua'dh</a>, one of the prominent leaders in Medina.Among the things Muhammad did in order to settle the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was drafting a document known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina\">Constitution of Medina</a> (date debated), establishing a kind of brotherhood among the eight Medinan tribes and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhajirun\">Muslim emigrants from Mecca</a>, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including that of the Muslim community to other communities specifically the Jews and other \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book\">Peoples of the Book</a>\"). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah\">umma</a></em>, had a religious outlook but was also shaped by the practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_of_Arabia\">Arab tribes</a>.Muhammad's adoption of facing north towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem\">Jerusalem</a> when performing the daily prayers (<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla\">qibla</a></em>) however need not to necessarily be a borrowing from the Jews as the reports about the direction of prayer before migration to Medina are contradictory and further this direction of prayer was also practiced among other groups in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula\">Arabia</a>.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Write on the Hadith collection of Imam Bukhari.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Bukhari states, \"There was once a time during one of our sessions when my teacher Ishaaq Ibn Rahway remarked it would be appreciated if someone could collect ahadith which held strong and reliable testimonials and write them in the form of a book.\" This inspired Bukhari which was later strengthened by a dream in which Bukhari met the Prophet (SAW). Upon waking, he visited several interpreters for an appropriate interpretation. They all answered that it meant he would in future cleanse the Prophet (SAW) of all lies spoken by the people through narrating misunderstood ahadith. This gave Bukhari great comfort and strength once he started the writing of his book Al-Jame-ul-Sahih. The complete name of the book is ˜Al-Jame-ul-Sahih-al-Musnad-min-ahaadeethe-Rasulillah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam-wa-sunanihi-wa-Ayyaamihi, which means a collected version of ahadith in the form of a book which relates to us the sayings, actions and the life of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam (SAW).<br>\n<br>\nBukhari had taken great care in writing the ahadith and choosing those which met the standards and conditions which he set to find ahadith with only strong testimonials which included only reliable and trustworthy testifiers. He spent 16 years in writing the book, altering it a total of three times. Allaamah Ayni reports of Ibn Tahir's remark that Bukhari had written Sahih Bukhari in his hometown Bukhara. Ibn Bujair however, relates that he had started his compiling in Makkah, and some have reported of seeing him in Basra. There is still another differing remark made by others who comment on seeing him in Madinah to write his book. However, we find Bukhari relating himself that he wrote Sahih Bukhari in Masjid-e-Haraam.<br>\n<br>\nBefore he actually placed a hadith in his compilation he used to perform ghusl and prayed to Allah(SWT) through two rakah nafl prayers asking for guidance. Bukhari worked such that only after being completely satisfied with the hadith in question did he give it a place in his book. Due to this great care which was taken, the people were heard to say that the ahadith which Bukhari has narrated have been so carefully phrased and with such precision that it is felt that Bukhari had heard the ahadith directly through the Prophet(SAW).</p><p><br>\nAbu Zaid Marwazi reports that I was once asleep in between the ˜Black stone' and ˜Maqaam-e-Ibrahim' when the Prophet (SAW) appeared in my dream he stated, \"O Abu Zaid! For how long shall you teach Imam Shafi's book ? When shall you start the teaching of my book?\"<br>\nI questioned, \"O Prophet (SAW)! Which book is yours?\" He replied, \"Mohammed Ibn Ismail's Al-Jame-ul-Sahih.\"<br>\n<br>\nHafiz Ibn Hajar reports that Bukhari has kept it of utmost importance to only narrate ahadith of a strong testimonial which can be proven by the name of the book. However, along with this Bukhari also made an effort to explain all points which are difficult to understand, which is the reason why he has given a plentiful host of meanings for one sentence which may include a word that is in reality difficult to understand. Bukhari has included within his book(s) the art of narrating ahadith which have been divided into eight different chapters. These chapters contain subjects which have been sub-titled and are famous for the ingenious way in which they have been phrased.<br>\n<br>\nBukhari has imposed conditions which all narrators and testifiers must meet before the hadith can be selected. One condition requires that all testifiers must have a strong memory. There are also restrictions made upon this condition:<br>\n<br>\nAll the Muhadditheen who possess great knowledge of ahadith must agree upon the testifiers... in question ability to learn and memorize, along with his reporting techniques.<br>\nThe testimonial must be complete without any missing testifiers.</p><p>If there are two different narrators of a hadith related to them by a Sahaabi then the hadith shall be given a high stage in rank. However, if only one narrator can be found and the testimonial proves to be a strong one then this shall be accepted without any doubts.<br>\n<br>\nAllaamah Nawawi relates that all scholars in Islam have agreed that Sahih Bukhari has earnestly gained the reward of being the most authentic after the Holy Qura'an.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Highlight the significance of Zakat.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Zakah is the third of the Five Pillars of Islam. It is giving money to the poor. Muslims believe that it is their duty to ensure Allah’s wealth has been distributed equally as everyone is the same - Allah created everyone equally. If a Muslim decides not to follow the pillar of Zakah, it may affect how they are judged in the afterlife. This could make it more likely that they will be sent to Hell (Jahannam) rather than Paradise (Jannah).</p><p>Zakah means ‘that which purifies’. By giving money to charity, Muslims can cleanse their wealth. It is important that Muslims do not get attached to unnecessary things such as money and possessions. Islam teaches that focusing on wealth and material possessions does not make a good Muslim.</p><p>Zakah refers to a Muslim giving 2.5% of their earnings to charity, after they have paid for what is necessary to support themselves and their family. This means that people who are too poor are not required to suffer hardship in order to give Zakah. Muslims see wealth as ultimately belonging to Allah, and giving Zakah helps to make people more equal. Helping one another is also seen as helping Allah. Zakah donations help Muslims to purify their souls by not being greedy. It is said that the giver of the money will receive a ‘hundred-fold’ back in the afterlife. This means that the giver of the money will receive back a hundred times what they gave as Zakah during their life.</p><p>Some Muslims perform Zakah by giving directly to a charity. Others contribute to donations in the mosque, which then distributes the money to people in need.</p><p>As well as donating money in a mosque, some Muslims choose to invest time or money (known as Sadaqah) in a chosen charity of their choice. They do this in order to please Allah. However, there are some limitations to how Muslims can donate their time and money. According to Surah 9 in the Qur’an, Zakah can only be used for the following:</p><ul>\n<li>helping the poor</li>\n<li>helping people in need</li>\n<li>freeing prisoners, slaves or captives</li>\n<li>helping people out of debt</li>\n</ul>",
