        "question": "<p>Explain any five issues mentioned in the sermon of Hajjul Wadac (Farewell Pilgrimage).</p>",
        "answer": "<h2>1. Uphold human dignity</h2><p>The month of Zulhijjah is one of the most sacred and significant months in the Islamic calendar. The month of Hajj (pilgrimage), where Muslims from all walks of life gather to seek Allah's pleasure and fulfil the 5th pillar of Islam. Indeed, this is a month of increased spirituality.</p><p>The Prophet s.a.w. equated the sanctity of life and humankind with this sacred month. This indicates the importance of humanity and the value of respecting one another's rights in Islam. Society is entitled to and worthy of reverence and respect. Our rights should be highly valued and our lives are sacred.</p><p>To attain peace in a society, no one shall harm or hurt one another, or even trespass upon another’s property. The Prophet s.a.w. continued:</p><p><em>\"Hurt no one, so that no one may hurt you.\"</em></p><p>It is undeniably our responsibility to treat people how we want to be treated. Hurt can be in various forms, be it physical, emotional or psychological, verbal or non-verbal.</p><p>We should continuously reflect on ourselves - our words, our actions - and how they can affect people. Seek peace, and you will find it. The Prophet s.a.w mentioned in a hadith:</p><p>“<em>A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfil his needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection. Whoever screens (humiliates) a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection.\"</em></p><p>(Sahih Al-Bukhari)</p><p>As Muslims, we must show love and care for one another. The term 'love' refers to a pure intent for good and benefit to come to others. This love that we should have between humankind is celestial and spiritual, not just earthly. Our love and care for others also are extended to all creation of Allah s.w.t. </p><p>It is the nature of the baser-self that desire harm to occur unto their enemies or discriminate against those who are not like them based on creed, colour or character. theless, humankind ought to oppose these blameworthy traits and instead, seek good for others.</p><h2>2. Honour and respect the rights of women</h2><p>Women are not the property of men and their rights are given by Allah s.w.t. which no men can take it from them. The Prophet s.a.w. emphasised the principles of mutual love, trust and respect. </p><p><em>\"O People, it is true that you have certain rights concerning your women, but they also have rights over you.\" </em>The Prophet s.a.w. later mentioned,<em> \"Remember that you have taken them as your wives, only under Allah's s.w.t trust and with his permission.\"</em></p><p>Rasulullah s.a.w. taught us that indeed women and men are partners. As partners, women and men complement one another. Being partners means that we share a lot of things together as husband and wife. In creating a harmonious living environment, there is a need to understand each other and be kind to one another.</p><p><em>“I enjoin you to treat women well and be kind to them”</em></p><p>Rasulullah s.a.w. uplifted the status of women during his time. Several pre-Islamic patriarchal practices were reformed. Women were given voices and spaces to air their views and grievances. They played significant roles in the development of Islam.</p><p>Today, we should continue to honour this legacy of Rasulullah s.a.w. by treating women around us with kindness and respect. </p><h2>3. Avoid economic inequality</h2><p>The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. emphasised the importance of socio-economic justice. As mentioned in some sources on the final sermon:</p><p><em>“And give your wealth in Zakat”</em></p><p>Economic inequality happens when wealth and opportunity are not distributed evenly within the society. This may lead to the poor being stuck at the lower socio-economic class. </p><p>The practice of Zakat will ideally create a more just society through this wealth-sharing mechanism to achieve a fairer distribution of wealth and for the socio-economic development of the community. </p><p>Allah s.w.t mentioned in the Quran;</p><p>وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱرْكَعُوا۟ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ</p><p><em>“Establish prayer, pay alms-tax (Zakat), and bow down with those who bow down.”</em></p><p>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:8)</p><p>This Quranic verse tells us that Zakat is an individual obligation for every Muslim. It is, in fact, the third pillar of Islam as narrated in a hadith. Islam prioritises the importance of purifying ones wealth by distributing them to the needy and other <em>asnaf</em> (beneficiaries of Zakat). </p><p>As mentioned in the Quran:</p><p>خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِم بِهَا</p><p><em>“Take (O Muhammad s.a.w.), from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them to increase.”</em></p><p>(Surah At-Taubah, 9:103)  </p><p>Other than purifying one’s wealth, Zakat is a form of gratitude for Allah’s bounty unto us. It also brings a sense of serenity and well-being as a Muslim when providing for others and doing our part for the socio-economic well-being of our community. Nowadays, Zakat payments can even be made <a href=\"https://www.muis.gov.sg/Zakat/Zakat-Payments/Zakat-Payments/Overview\">online</a>.</p><p>The final sermon also stressed on the harmful effects of usury such that it is prohibited for this practice to be continued. The message is clear that, as Muslims, we should prevent any form of economic exploitation. </p><h2>4. Do not discriminate</h2><p><em>“All humankind is from Adam a.s and Hawa a.s. An Arab has no superiority over a non- Arab, nor does a non-Arab have superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white - except by piety and good action.''</em></p><p>A human is judged entirely by his/her righteousness, not because of his/her race, colour or socioeconomic status. Racism, discrimination, bigotry and social injustice still exist in today’s society. We tend to judge people based on their physical attributes, looking past what their hearts can offer.</p><p>No nation is created to be above another; the differences between humankind is for us to embrace and learn from one another. Allah s.w.t mentions in the Quran;</p><p>يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَٰكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَٰكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَىٰكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ</p><p><em>“O humankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the noblest of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.”</em></p><p>(Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:13)</p><p>Let us all take a step back and instead of discriminating against others, reflect deeply on ourselves and our hearts so that we can become better people.</p><p>Islam does not promote the superiority of one's race or lineage. Although one can be from a noble lineage, it is only something to be venerated when his/her actions are likewise honourable. Imam Al-Haddad mentioned:</p><p><em>\"No person of any consequence should respect or praise an ignorant man, even if he is of noble birth and virtuous ancestry, for respecting and praising such a person in his presence may harm him. It may deceive him concerning God, render him neglectful of proper behaviour and distract him from gathering provision for the Hereafter.\"</em></p><p>Our hearts are valuable and sacred. Don't let our eyes disregard others’ hearts while we are too focused on physical differences.</p><h2>5. Hold true to the teachings of Islam</h2><p><em>\"O people, no Prophet or Messenger will come after me and no new faith will be born. Therefore, understand the words which I convey to you. I will leave two things; the Quran and the Sunnah, and if you follow these you will never go astray.\"</em></p><p>Throughout his last sermon, the Prophet s.a.w. profoundly reminded us about the importance of rights between humankind. Towards the end of the sermon, he s.a.w. reminded us that after his departure, there would be no Messenger after him to guide us, but he did not leave us empty-handed. The Prophet s.a.w. left us with two primary<strong> </strong>sources of Islam: the Quran and the Sunnah. These encompass the pillars of faith.</p><p>As Muslims, we should be mindful of our rights and duties towards Allah s.w.t. such as praying daily, fasting in the month of Ramadan and performing Zakat and Hajj for those who can afford and are physically able. To be mindful of these duties is what makes us a Muslim.</p><p>The Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. is not present with us physically to guide us in our lives but he s.a.w. is with us in our hearts through the light of the Quran and Sunnah.</p><p><em>“And if you follow this, you will never go astray”.</em></p><p>The Prophet s.a.w. also gave us the responsibility, as mentioned earlier, to pass on the baton of his message and the word of Islam and its goodness to others. It is, therefore, our duty to ensure the timeless message of Rasulullah’s s.a.w. remains relevant to our time and locality. </p><p><em>“All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; perhaps some of those who receive my words would understand them better than those who listened to me directly.”</em></p><p>Islam is a universal religion that is not confined to a particular race or nation. Hence, we must uphold the values and principles of Islam. The Prophet s.a.w. then ended his final sermon by reading the verse from Surah Al-Ma’idah:</p>",

        "question": "<p><em>Explain eight other names by which the Qur 'a-n is known.</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>*<em>Huda</em></p><p>Quran is called <em>huda</em>, because it guides true people who are in search of Allah towards the right direction. You will hear stories of people becoming Muslims just by reading the Quran, and even that in English translation. Even when Muslims are confused or losing <em>taqwa</em>, we can gain it back just by reading the Quran, if Allah wills. We recite in <em>salah</em> everyday, ‘Guide us to the straight path.’ The answer to that dua is the rest of the Quran. </p><p><em>*Arabiy</em></p><p>The Quran is the Book that was sent to the Prophet (saws) through Jibreel (as) by Allah, and that was in Arabic. That is the only Quran, and what we read in English or any other language are just translations of the meanings of the Quran. That is why it is so important to <a href=\"https://understandquran.com/courses/short-course-1.html\">learn Arabic</a> in order to understand the Quran in its own language.</p><p>*<em>Adheem</em></p><p>Allah the Exalted calls the Quran <em>adheem</em> – great, magnificent, grandiose. It is the paper book we have that is so grandiose that we showcase it on tops of our shelves? No, the thing which Allah called magnificent is the verbal Quran that was given to the Prophet. How do we honour this magnificent gift from Allah? By reading it.</p><p><em>*Balaagh</em></p><p><em>This [Qur’an] is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but one God and that those of understanding will be reminded.</em> [14:52]</p><p><em>Balaagh</em> is a clear message. Allah said here that the Quran is a message for all people. This is the last ayah of this surah, and Allah said in the first ayah of this surah:</p><p><em>Alif-Lam-Ra. (This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light.</em> [14:1]</p><p><em>*Bayyinah</em></p><p><em>Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted [from misbelief] until there came to them clear evidence</em> – [98:1]</p><p><em>Bayyinah</em> is a crystal clear evidence after which no doubt at all remains of the truth. So whenever in doubt, all we need to do is look in the Quran. It is not just a message, it is evidence by itself.</p><p><em>*Rahmah</em></p><p><em>Indeed, this Qur’an relates to the Children of Israel most of that over which they disagree. </em><em>And indeed, it is guidance and mercy for the believers</em>. [27:76-77]</p><p>The Quran is a mercy on us. It is our guide towards everything that is good in this world and the Hereafter. No matter how much we chase worldly desires and worldly success, nothing gives us true inner peace except remembrance of Allah, and Quran itself is called <em>dhikr</em> by Allah, as we shall see later in sha Allah.</p><p><em>*Bushra</em></p><p><em>Say, “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel – it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur’an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah , confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.”</em> [2:97]</p><p>The Quran is glad tidings, for whom? Only for the true believers. In it you will find the descriptions of Paradise, and the promise of good things from Allah if you truly believe.</p><p><em>*Nadheer</em></p><p><em>A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Qur’an for a people who know, </em><em>As a giver of good tidings and a warner; but most of them turn away, so they do not hear.</em> [41:3-4]</p><p>The Quran warns us about the consequences of disobeying our Master. It gives us descriptions of punishments which may befall sinners, in order to warn us not to be among them. This warning in itself is a mercy from Allah, giving us the opportunity to get our acts together.</p>",
