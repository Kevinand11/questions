        "question": "<p>Explain any eight factors which led to the spread of Islam in West Africa.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The following are the reasons for the spread Islam in West Africa. By the end of the fifteenth century, Islam had spread southwards to the fringes of the forest belt.</p><p>i.               The Nature of Islam</p><p>The nature of Islam as a religion accepting polygamy to some extent, its tolerance of traditional African religions, its simplicity of doctrine and mode of worship helped propagators to make converts in Africa. These factors also made Islam easily adaptable to the African communities with which it came in contact. Again, the Islamisation of Africa was paralleled by the Africanisation of Islam. The making and sale of charms and amulets, which were believed to offer protection against evil forces and generally ensure success in life, were important in winning over converts.</p><p>ii.             Trade</p><p>Another major reason that led to the rapid spread of Islam in West Africa was the trans-Saharan trade network. From the seventh century onwards, Muslim traders from the Maghreb and the Sahara started settling first in some of the market centres in the Sahel and then in the Savanna areas. Al-Bakri, a renowned Arabic Scholar and merchant wrote in 1067, that the capital of ancient Ghana was already divided into two parts; about six miles apart, the Muslim traders’ part which had as many as twelve mosques and the King’s part had one mosque for the use of the king’s Muslim visitors. It was these resident Muslim traders who converted the rulers and the principal local town’s people to Islam. Also, according to Kano Chronicles, during the reign of Yaji, the King of Kano from 1349 to 1385, the Wangarawa came from Melle bringing the Mohammedan religion. These examples grew the process of Islamisation or conversion to Islam, as it gathered momentum.</p><p>iii.           Activities of Muslim Clerics</p><p>Islam also spread into West Africa through the activities of Muslim clerics, marabouts and scholars or mallams. These clerics or learned men founded their own religious centres which attracted students from all parts of the Western Sudan and who on the completion of their studies and training went back to their own homes to win converts. Many of them went on lecture or missionary tours to convert people, while others became advisers to Sudanese Kings on how to become effective rulers. Some clerics devoted a great deal of their time to writing books and instructions on all aspects of Islam for the education and conversion of people or the purification and strengthening of Islam. Some examples of clerics follow:</p><p>Ibu Khadija al-Kumi, a Muslim missionary and Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, a poet, scholar and architect from Granada were both invited by Mansa Musa to accompany him on his return from his celebrated pilgrimage in 1324/5. Both of them settled in Mali where they taught Islam. Al-Sahili also designed the great mosque of Timbuktu as well as a magnificent palace for Mansa Musa in the capital of Mali.</p><p>Again, the great Mande scholar, Abd Rahman Zaite (now identified as Abd al-Rahman Jakhite) settled in Kano on the invitation of Rumfa, the King of Kano. He built a mosque and introduced the practice of Koran recital and other devotional exercises.</p><p>Another brilliant Berber scholar called Abd al-Rahman al-Maghili (1477-78) established his Zawiyaie Islamic school in Tuat in the Sahara, and from there went on a missionary tour of the Western Sudan which lasted from 1492 to 1503. During this tour, he visited Air, Takedda, Kano, Katsina and Gao and preached to both rulers and commoners.</p><p>iv.           Activities of Rulers</p><p>Islam gained ground in West Africa through the activities of the individual rulers. The rulers of the Western Sudan encouraged the trans-Saharan trade and extended hospitality to both traders and visiting clerics, but perhaps one of the most important ways in which they encouraged acceptance of Islam was through their own conversion. With a Muslim King or ruler it rapidly became a matter of prestige among the aristocracy also to convert to Islam in many kingdoms. Many rulers made considerable efforts to encourage Muslim institutions such as Islamic tax and legal systems or the provision of facilities such as mosques, through the appointment of Muslim officials such as judges and butchers who observe the Islamic code and to lead prayers, celebrating Muslim festival and ordering every town under their control to observe the ritual prayers. The pilgrimages that many of the rulers undertook – such as Mansa Musa and Askia Mohammed — had a considerable spiritual effect increasing their determination both to strengthen and purify Islam and to spread it even further.</p><p>v.             Holy War</p><p>What is more, another way in which Islam was introduced and spread in West Africa in general and the Western Sudan in particular was the militant jihad, or the waging of holy war against infidels or lukewarm Muslims. This method allowed the third and final stage of the process of Islamisation to reach its climax with the nineteenth-century <em>jihad</em> in the Western Sudan, between Mali and Senegambia and Hausaland in northern Nigeria.</p><p>The first <em>jihad</em> in the Western Sudan which has accounts was that waged by the head of the Sudanese confederation. It was Tarsina against the Sudanese people in 1023, soon after his return from the pilgrimage to Mecca. He was killed during these clashes. The second is that of the King of Takrur, War-Ajabbi, before his death in 1040. The third and the best known of these early jihads was the one declared by the Almoravid movement of ancient Ghana between 1048 and 1054 by the scholar, Abdallah Ibn Yasin. Between 1056 and 1070s, the Almoravid conquered the whole area between ancient Ghana and Sijilmasa. By 1087 the Almoravid Empire stretched from the Senegal in the south across the Mediterranean to Spain in the north.</p><p>vi.           Inter-marriage</p><p>Islam also spread on to West Africa through inter-marriages. The Muslim merchants from North Africa came down settled and married the African women who became Muslims including their children.</p><p>vii.         Scholars</p><p>The early Muslim missionaries opened Islamic schools and colleges. The products of these schools and colleges also did well by spreading the religion. They worked with the rulers as advisors, councilors etc. for instance, Ibn Yasin established a Zaniyaor college and founded the Almoravid movement which contributed considerably to the spread of Islam in the Sahara and Western Sudan. Also one of the greatest clerics and missionaries of the Western Sudan was al-Hajj Suware, the Soninke scholar founded the important Zawiga at Diakha – Bambuk which attracted students from all over the Western Sudan during the first half of the thirteenth century. Scholarship was indeed also attractive to rulers in West Africa, because the widespread use of the Arabic script made administering their kingdoms easier, and tax revenues easier to accrue. Thus, Timbuktu became known for its famous Djingnereber Mosque and prestigious Sankore University, both of which were established in the early 1300s under the reign of the Mali Empire, most famous ruler Mansa Musa.</p>",

The contents of the Surah also confirm this idea.

        "answer": "<p>On the authority of Abu Hamza Anas Ibn Maalik, the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), from the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said, \" of you [truly] believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\" [Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim]   »لايؤمن أحدكم حتى يحب لأخيه ما يحب لنفسه« رواه البخاري ومسلم   Takhreej   This hadeeth was reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasaa’i, ibn Maajah, Ahmad, ibn Hibbaan, al-Daarimi, Abu Yala and numerous others. It should be noted that the narration in Sahih Muslim differs slightly from what al-Nawawi has presented here. The narration in Muslim states: \" of you truly believes until he loves for his brother - or he said for his neighbor - what he loves for himself.\"   »لايؤمن أحدكم حتى يحب لأخيه (أوقال لجاره) مايحب لنفسه« رواه مسلم   In Muslim's narration there is mention of the doubt about the exact wording \"or he said\". However, in al-Bukhari's narration there is no such doubt.   Another important narration of this hadeeth may be found in Musnad Ahmad. It states, \"By the One in whose hand is my soul, a servant does not truly believe until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself of goodness.\"   »والذي نفسي بيده لا يؤمن عبدحتى يحب لأخيه ما يحب لنفسه من الخير‏« رواه أحمد   Here, the last words, \"of goodness\" have been added to this narration. As shall be noted below, these additional words are of significance. There is also another narration with the wording: \"The servant does not reach the reality of [or true] faith until he loves for the people what he loves for himself.\" [Reported by Imam Ahmad is his Musnad]   »لا يبلغ العبد حقيقة الإيمان حتى يحب للناس ما يحب لنفسه« رواه أحمد فى مسنده   General comments about the Hadith   This hadeeth stipulates one of the most important rules of behavior in Islam. It is a clear sign as to how Muslims are supposed to behave toward one another. It states a general principle that may be applied in all walks of life. The importance of this principle is so great that some consider this hadeeth one-fourth or one-third of Islam.<br>\n<br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>Describe the aims of the Jihad of various reformers in West Africa.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>On developing a stable economy to finance development and bring prosperity to the population, some caliphates were largely successful. The Sokoto Caliphate under the control of Muhammad Bello and Wazir Gidado established a strong economy based on agriculture and artisan goods. This economic growth allowed them to fund political, educational and military development within the Caliphate which lead to it invading and conquering surrounding areas, increasing the number of people under its administration and so achieving the secondary aim of spreading the word of Islam. However, other groups, even within the Sokoto Caliphate, were not able to establish such a stable economy, such as under the Masina jihad of Shaikh Ahmad. During his conflict he struggled to establish a strong economy due to his lack of resources to safely guard the roaming cattle herds and as such, large parts of the military activity Hindered by a lack of military and economic resources, due to a more defensive strategy, the Masina jihad was less successful in conquering other areas and spreading its domain of control on the same scale as the Sokoto Caliphate. It can therefore be seen that the development of a stable economy and a strong armed force were largely linked, with different jihad movements having varying strengths in these departments, resulting in different levels of success.</p><p>In their defence against European invaders few groups were successful and, instead of defeating the invaders, many Muslim populations had to carry out mass migrations across northern Africa to escape. Those fighting under the jihad of Al-Hajj Vmar were forced to flee, as they were unable to push the French forces out of the Senegal River region. This action heavily damaged the legitimacy of this jihad's leadership as it showed the people that their leaders could not protect them effectively. One benefit of this occurring however, was that it created a greater sense of Muslim identity and caused many Caliphates to increase their interactions with other Caliphates, unifying them against a common enemy and reducing the internal fighting amongst the different groups. So, although many of the Caliphates were unable to achieve their goal of being able to operate an effective military defence against European invaders, they were able to achieve the goal of increasing intra-Muslim relations and cooperation, by doing so increasing the sense of Islamic unity and identity.</p><p>When it came to the task of establishing strong and legitimate rule over the Caliphates, the Islamic protagonists were not always successful. In the Hamdullahi Caliphate there was a strong sense of legitimacy under the 30 years rule of Seku Amadu but he failed to name a successor. This led to confusion and ultimately it was decided by council that his son should rule. Unfortunately for his son, this decree did not carry the same sense of legitimacy as if Amadu had himself selected his child. The son's plans actually differed from his father, especially on teaching, and as such he failed to gain the support of the older cohorts of the population. This inability to maintain a consistent plan for the area damaged the legitimacy of the ruling classes. That having been said, many groups followed a hereditary ideal behind leadership and so the handing down of power by father to son was frequent across the Islamic groups and still retained legitimacy for ruling groups. This can be seen in the Sokoto caliphate were the main leaders, the Sultans, all belonged to the same family who descended from Usman Dan Fodio.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Write on attitude to ones parents according to the Qur;an.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Our indebtedness to our parents is so immense that it is not possible to repay it fully. In lieu of this, it becomes obligatory for us to show the utmost kindness, respect, and obedience to our parents. The position of parents, and the mutual obligations and responsibilities, have been addressed in Islam in great detail. The Qur'anic commandments, as well as the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) guide us in this matter. The parent-child code of behavior in Islam is unique, since rules were laid down by divine command.</p><p>References to parents have been made at least 15 times in the Holy Qur'an. There are numerous traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) on this subject. I will first quote some of the Qur'anic verses here:</p><p>\"And We have enjoined on man (to be good) to his parents. In travail upon travail did his mother bear him, and in two years was his weaning. Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents; to Me is thy final goal.\" (<a href=\"http://www.islamicity.com/Quransearch/action.lasso.asp?-database=Quran&amp;-Table=tblMasterTranslit&amp;-Response=Sreply1.asp&amp;-Error=SReply1.asp&amp;-token=English&amp;-op=qrange&amp;CV=31:14\" target=\"_blank\">Quran 31:14</a>)</p><p>According to the above verse, gratitude to God and to parents go hand in hand. Gratitude to God is incomplete without showing gratitude to one's parents. Since being grateful to God is a form of ibadah (worship) which earns heavenly rewards, it can therefore be said that being grateful to one's parents also earns heavenly rewards.</p><p>\"Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind to parents. Whether one or more attain old age in thy life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor. And out of kindness, lower to them the wing of humility, and say, \"my Lord! bestow on them Thy Mercy, even as they cherished me in childhood.\" (<a href=\"http://www.islamicity.com/Quransearch/action.lasso.asp?-database=Quran&amp;-Table=tblMasterTranslit&amp;-Response=Sreply1.asp&amp;-Error=SReply1.asp&amp;-token=English&amp;-op=qrange&amp;CV=17:23-17:24\" target=\"_blank\">Quran 17: 23-24</a>)</p><p>\"We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents; in pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth.\" (<a href=\"http://www.islamicity.com/Quransearch/action.lasso.asp?-database=Quran&amp;-Table=tblMasterTranslit&amp;-Response=Sreply1.asp&amp;-Error=SReply1.asp&amp;-token=English&amp;-op=qrange&amp;CV=46:15\" target=\"_blank\">Quran 46:15</a>)</p><p>Thus, God has enjoined on us to show kindness, respect, and humility to our parents. We are commanded to do this, even though they may have injured us. The only exception to the above command is made in the following verse:</p><p>\"We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents; but if they strive (to force) thee to join with Me anything of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not.\" (<a href=\"http://www.islamicity.com/Quransearch/action.lasso.asp?-database=Quran&amp;-Table=tblMasterTranslit&amp;-Response=Sreply1.asp&amp;-Error=SReply1.asp&amp;-token=English&amp;-op=qrange&amp;CV=29:8\" target=\"_blank\">Quran 29:8</a>)</p><p>Some of the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, and of the learned members of his family, about our responsibilities toward our parents are quoted here:</p><p>\"Paradise lies under the feet of the mother.\"</p><p>\"God's pleasure is in the pleasure of the father, and God's displeasure is in the displeasure of the father.\"</p><p>\"He who wishes to enter Paradise through its best door must please his parents.\"</p><p>\"It is a pity that some people may not attain Paradise, on account of not serving their old parents.\"</p><p>\"If a person looks with love at his parents, God writes in his favor the reward equal to the performance of one Hajj.\"</p><p>[Someone asked, \"will this promise be good if one looks at his parents one hundred times a day?\" The Holy Prophet (pbuh) replied, \"even if one does so a hundred thousand times a day, God gives the reward accordingly.\"]</p><p>\"A man or woman is bound to be good to his or her parents, even though they may have injured him or her.\"</p><p>Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (r.a.), the great-great-grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is reported to have quoted Imam 'Ali (ra) that, \"disobedience to parents is a major sin.\" He also stated that, \"if a person looks at the face of his or her parents with wrathful eyes, despite the fact that injustice was done to him or her by the parents, his or her salah (prayer) will not be accepted by God.\"</p><p>According to one of the Hadith-e-Qudsi, the following is reported about the status of parents:</p><p>\"God has commanded that if anybody prays equal to the invocations performed by the prophets, such prayers will do no good if that person has been cursed by his or her parents.\"</p><p>It has also been related that the very first words which have been written on the Lauh-e-Mahfuz (The Heavenly Preserved Tablet) are:</p><p>\"I am God, and there is no deity except Me. I am pleased with those with whom their parents are pleased, and I am displeased with those with whom their parents are displeased.\"</p><p>Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is reported to have said: \"On the Day of Judgment, my person will not be seen by those who drank liquor, those who on hearing my name did not invoke the blessings of God on me, or those who were cursed and disowned by their parents.\"</p><p>'Ali ibn al-Husain (ra) is reported to have said: \"The right of your mother on you is that you should know that nobody could endure the trouble and the conditions under which she protected you and nourished you with the juice of her life, and tried with her heart and soul to satisfy all your needs in relation to hunger, thirst, dress, etc. She passed sleepless nights, suffering anxieties. She provided you with shelter against heat and cold, and protected you from ailments. It is not possible for you to compensate her, or thank her enough for all the services, except that God may give you guidance for that. The right of your father on you is that you should know that it is he who brought you into existence, and you are a branch of the tree of his life.\"</p><p>According to a reliable tradition, it is related that a man came to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and asked him to whom he should render kindness. The prophet told him to be kind to his mother. Three times he put the same question to the prophet, and three times he got the same answer. When he asked the question the fourth time, he was told to be kind to his father, indicating that the mother's right took precedence over that of the father.</p><p>Parents' duties: Islam has assigned certain duties to parents that they must fulfill. If they fail in those, they will be questioned about it. Besides providing the basic necessities of life, Islam requires that the parents teach their children about the Oneness of God, the Quranic commandments, values, the Prophets and their teachings, and the moral code of Islam as according to the Quran and the Sunnah (teachings) of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).</p><p>Let us pray to God that He guide us to be respectful, kind, and obedient to our parents, and that we continue to show them humility regardless of the power, position, wealth, and influence we may possess. Let us also pray that we be patient, kind, thoughtful, and friendly with our children, as we guide them through their lives, and that we discharge our responsibilities towards them as required by our religion, so that God may be pleased with us, and may He Bless and reward us, both in this world and in the Hereafter.  Ameen.</p>",

        "question": "<p>*What is Shar;ah?</p><p>*Explain its relevance to Muslims</p>",
        "answer": "<p>*Sharia, Islamic law, or redundantly Sharia law, is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the hadith.</p><p>*Sharia is a now a familiar term to Muslims and non-Muslims. It can often be heard in news stories about politics, crime, feminism, terrorism and civilisation.</p><p>All aspects of a Muslim's life are governed by Sharia. Sharia law comes from a combination of sources including the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/texts/quran_1.shtml\">Qur'an</a> (the Muslim holy book), the <em>Hadith</em> (sayings and conduct of the prophet Muhammad) and <em>fatwas</em> (the rulings of Islamic scholars).</p><p>Many people, including Muslims, misunderstand Sharia. It's often associated with the amputation of limbs, death by stoning, lashes and other medieval punishments. Because of this, it is sometimes thought of as draconian. Some people in the West view Sharia as archaic and unfair social ideas that are imposed upon people who live in Sharia-controlled countires.</p><p>Many Muslims, however, hold a different view. In the Islamic tradition Sharia is seen as something that nurtures humanity. They see the Sharia not in the light of something primitive but as something divinely revealed. In a society where social problems are endemic, Sharia frees humanity to realise its individual potential.</p>",
