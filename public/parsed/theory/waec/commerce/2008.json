The parties (insurer/insured) must disclose to themselves material facts that they know will affect their contract. If a party fails to do so the contract will be void at the option of the other party.</p><p>(d) <strong>Re-insurance: </strong>This is the process of sharing risks insured by an insurance company with other insurers.
