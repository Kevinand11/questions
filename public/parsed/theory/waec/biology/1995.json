        "answer": "<p>(a) A Cell can be defined as the basic structural and eg. Cool, Wood functional unit of a living organism. Or it could be Volcanoes referred to as the smallest unit of living organism or Diffusion basic unit of life</p><p><strong>(b) Structure of DNA: </strong>DNA consist Carbon dioxide In of two chains of nucleotides, twisted into each other the atmosphere p n to form a double helix.

The nitrogenous base from one chain link up with a compatible base of the opposite chain Dead and or adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine.

Absorption through roots</p><p><strong>(c) Description of the process of mitosis: </strong>Mitosis occurs. in somatic cells or body cells or meristematic cells. Inorganic salts of carbonates In soil At the beginning of mitosis or prophase nuclear membrane and nucleolus disappear. Chromosomes Losses in form of carbonates become more visible, the chromosomes replicate. of metals like calcium and potassium They are normally made up of two strands or chomatids, spindles are formed. Chromosomes are then arranged at the equator or middle of the cell or )  metaphase. The chromosomes attach themselves at the centromere to the spindle and chromatids separate at the centromere. Each member of the pair move to the opposite pole of the cell or anaphase. The two sets of chromatid grouped together at the opposite pole and become less visible or Telophase . The nuclear membrane reappears including the nucleolus. The cytoplasm constrict in animals cells to form daughter cells. In plant cells, wall is formed between two sets of chromatids. Then two daughter cells are formed.</p><p><strong>(d) Importance of mitosis to living organisms: </strong></p><p>(1) Mitosis helps in the growth or development.</p><p>(2) It assist in Repair of cells</p><p>(3) It also ensures exact copy of DNA or sum total of inherited factors or transmission of genes to the daughter cells or ensures consistency of DNA. )<br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Sensory cells are specialised cells which receive a particular stimulus. Normally they convert stimuli into impulses and transmit such impulses or sensation to the brain or spinal cord or central nervous system.</p><p>(b) (i) The function of lens is that it reflects rays or makes fine adjustment to focus object on the retina</p><p>(ii) Vitreous humour reflects light rays onto the retina or helps maintain spherical shape of the eye</p><p>(iii) Optic nerve transmits sensory impulses to the brain or transmits sensory impulses from the brain</p><p>(c )(i) The four structures which protect the eye against injury are<br>\n(1) Eye lids<br>\n(2) Eye lashes<br>\n(3) Eye socket or bonying socket<br>\n(4) conjunctive.<br>\nThe eye lid is closed to protect the eye from foreign particles or mechanical injury. During blinking it carries water from the tear glands to moisten or irrigate the eye with tear or water to keep it moist. Eye lashes also acts as a hood and protects the eye from glare or excessive light. It also shields the eye against sweat, water or dust. Conjunctiva provides protective shield to the inner most delicate structure and gets inflamed during infection instead of the entire eye. Eye socket houses or encloses the eye balls. It shields or gives protection from mechanical injury, e.g. from a blow.</p><p>(d) In a dark room, the iris contracts while the pupil dilates or opens widely to allow in more light. On sudden exposure to bright sun-light, the pupil which is still wide open allows in too much light which bleaches pigment in the rod cells and this causes the dazzling sensation experienced. The iris muscle gradually relaxes within a few seconds. The pupil constricts gradually to regulate the entry of the required amount of light for the vision to return to normal. <br>\n </p>",
