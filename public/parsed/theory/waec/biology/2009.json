        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) Sense organ:</strong> A sense organ is an organ made up of a group of specialized cells/tissues/receptors , which is able to receive/collect/perceive/detect stimulus and transmit the information/impulse/message to the nervous system.</p><p><strong>(b) Sense organs in mammals: </strong>Nose/olfactory organ; eye; ear; tongue; skin.</p><p>(<strong>c) When a person spins and stops:</strong><br>\nEndolymph, in the inner ear/semi circular canals continues to move causing sensory hairs/sensory cells to be stimulated. impulses reaching the brain/cerebellum through the auditory nerve show that the person is still spinning the brain interprets the body as still moving - and confusion is imposed on the receptors - sensitive to position - giving the person an impression of dizziness.</p><p><strong>(d) Functions of:</strong><br>\n(i) <strong>Cerebellum </strong>- Receives impulses from the ear; involved in balance and posture; coordinates voluntary muscles.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Cerebrum </strong>- Controls voluntary actions/any other correct example; concerned with memory; intelligence.</p><p><strong>(iii) Medulla Oblongata: </strong>Controls involuntary/reflex actions; heartbeat; coughing; sneezing; blinking/any other correct involuntary actions. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)Why an athlete should be given glucose drink: </strong>Glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrates/soluble form of carbohydrate; an energy-giving food substance which does not require any form of digestion. - hence it is absorbed in the ileum/small intestine. - where it diffuses/enters into the blood stream/circulatory system. - it is then assimilated; and oxidized. - within the shortest time/quickly/immediately. - to give energy to the athlete. - bread is a complex carbohydrate/polysaccharide/starch. - which will require a series of digestive processes/hydrolysis. - which starts in the mouth; and ends in small intestine/ileum. - this takes a longer time to produce energy for use/cannot give immediate energy.</p><p><strong>(b) Test for starch: -</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Macerate/crush a piece of the food substance.</li>\n<li>add water to the crushed food to form a solution/suspension/take a piece of food substance.</li>\n<li>put a few drops of the solution/suspension/ piece of food.</li>\n<li> on a white tile/watch glass/in test tube</li>\n<li>add one or two drops of iodine solution</li>\n<li> the solution/piece of food will turn blue black</li>\n<li>indicating the presence of starch.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>(c) Importance of water in human diet: </strong>-</p><ul>\n<li>Water is an essential part of living protoplasm; blood</li>\n<li>it acts as a solvent; and transport medium in the body for food substances/gases/hormones.</li>\n<li>transports waste excretory products</li>\n<li>it is a medium for chemical reactions/digestive processes</li>\n<li>it function in distribution of body heat</li>\n<li>it is the main component of the synovial fluid of joints; amniotic fluid</li>\n<li>serves a protective function in the brain</li>\n<li>allows easy movement of food through the digestive tract.<br>\n </li>\n</ul>",

        "answer": "<p><strong> Food chain:</strong> This is a linear feeding relationship; in which energy is transferred from producer/plants; through a series of organisms/trophic levels; in which each organism feeds on the preceding one; and provides food for the succeeding one in the habitat.</p><p><strong>Terrestrial food chain: </strong>Terrestrial organism correctly named (TN) - Producer listed first correctly named primary consumer; secondary consumer; and tertiary consumer/decomposer; correct direction of arrows (CA)</p><p><strong>(c)(i) Flow of energy:</strong> Energy flow is unidirectional/non-cyclic; it is either utilized; or stored. Light energy from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll in green plants; and used in photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates; the chemical energy in the carbohydrate is passed down the food chain; when the primary consumers feed on the plants/producer; the chemical energy is passed along the food chain to the secondary consumer; and then to the tertiary consumer/decomposer.</p><p><strong>(ii) Energy loss: - </strong>Energy is lost at each tropic level - when a herbivore/primary consumer feeds on a plant/producer; not all parts of the plant is eaten; as a result not all the energy in the plant/ producer is consumed; plants lose energy via respiration, do not utilize all the energy present in preceding members; energy is also lost in respiration; excretion, movement; and other metabolic activities. <br>\n </p>",
