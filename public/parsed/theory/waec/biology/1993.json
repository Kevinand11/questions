        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) Diseases of plants caused by bacteria are: </strong><br>\n(i) Soft roots<br>\n(ii) fire blight, wilts, crown gall. Disease of animals caused by bacteria are tuberculosis, cholera, leprosy , gonorrhoea, syphilis, diptheria, tetanus</p><p><strong>(ii) Ways in which bacteria are useful are: </strong></p><p>(1) Some bacteria are used in the preparation of cheese, butter and vinegar.</p><p>(2) Some are used in the production of antibiotics, enzymes, vitamins and amino acids for commercial purposes.</p><p>(3) In leguminous plants, bacteria such as Rhizobium found in the root nodules convert atmospheric nitrogen to soil nitrogen thus enhancing the nitrogen content of the soil.</p><p>(4) Some bacteria help in the digestion of cellulose</p><p>(5) Some bacteria help in the fermentation of alcohol and beverages.</p><p>(6) Certain bacteria known as sewage bacteria assist in the decomposition of sewage into harmless substances that could be used as manure.</p><p><strong>(b) Mosquitoes can be controlled in the following ways: </strong></p><p>(1) Bush around the surrounding should be cleared to prevent breeding grounds for mosquitoes.</p><p>(2) Mosquito net should be provided or fitted to our windows to prevent mosquitoes from coming within to suck human blood.</p><p>(3) Apply insecticides to kill mosquito or pour kerosine or oil on stagnant water around the house to prevent breeding.</p><p>(c) <strong>Aim</strong>: To show the presence of bacteria under the finger nails.<br>\n<strong>Apparatus</strong>: Incubator, innoculating loop, nail cutter, petridish, blood agar, microscope and cover slip.<br>\n<strong>Procedure</strong>: Cut the finger nails and place them in a petridish which have the blood agar. Then incubate at 37°C for two days.<br>\n<strong>Observation</strong>: It was discovered that colonies of bacteria were growing on the blood agar. On gram staining, one saw clusters of cocci bacteria. <strong>Conclusion</strong>: The growth of cocci bacteria indicates that bacteria grow on finger nails. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) Inhalation involves the contraction of the outer muscles of the diaphragm which makes the diaphragm to pull downward and the intercostal muscles to contract to raise the ribs. The two movements increase the volume of the lungs, thereby reducing the pressure of the air inside them. This enables the air at atmospheric pressure to go into the lungs.</p><p>(b) In the shoot system of flowering plants, gaseous exchange takes place through the stomata of the leaves, the green parts and the lenticels at the bark of stem. Stoma is a hole enclosed by two guard cells which change in volume due to osmotic pressure in the guard cells. When the osmotic pressure in the guard cells is high, they become turgid and this makes the stoma to open and when the pressure is low, the guard cells become flaccid and this makes the stoma to close. Generally, exchange of gases in and out of the leaves and lenticels is controlled by the opening and closing of the stomata.</p><p><strong>(c) Experiment to demonstrate the effect of distilled water on mammalian red blood cell: </strong><br>\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To show that distilled water has effect on the red blood cell.<br>\n<strong>Apparatus</strong>: Beaker, distilled water, thistle funnel, ether, pig's bladder and red blood cells.<br>\n<strong>Method</strong>: The pig's bladder is dissolved in ether to make it soft and used to close or seal the stem end of the thistle funnel. Then pour the red blood cells into the thistle funnel and immerse in water inside the beaker. Mark the initial level of both solutions.<br>\n<strong>Observation and conclusion:</strong> It was observed that the level of red blood cells had risen in the thistle funnel indicating that the distilled water moved into the thistle funnel via the pig's bladder. <br>\n </p>",

The characteristics of Northern Guinea Savanna are: </strong></p><p>(i) It has bare soil with scanty trees.</p><p>(ii) Has long twisted roots to facilitate the absorption of water and mineral salts.</p><p>(iii) Possesses thick barks which enable it to withstand harsh weather, e.g. fire and intensive sunlight.</p><p>(iv) Has twisted and gnarled trunks, which enable it to resist fire and excessive transpiration.</p><p>(v) Availability of herbivorous animals such as zebra, squirrel, antelope, grasscutter etc.</p><p>(vi).Availability of perennial grasses that grow in tufts and resist fire.</p><p>(vii) Presence of underground stems, e.g. spear grass which make the plants to be able to survive, after long period of dry season or fire out break.</p><p>(viii) Temperature is usually above 18°C throughout the year.</p><p>(ix) Trees shed their leaves during the dry season and this enables them to conserve water.</p><p>(b) <strong>Aim</strong>: To estimate the density of a plant species using quadrat sampling technique (a method of studying plant species).<br>\n<strong>Method</strong>: A quadrat is a rectangular frame which is constructed from wire or wood of known dimension. Before usage, mark the area where the species to be measured occurs. Then throw the quadrat to land randomly on any part of the marked off area. Note the area covered at each landing of the quadrat. In the process, each species of plant is counted and recorded. To determine the density, calculate the average frequency of the plant species as the number of times the plant species occurs divided by the total number of quadrat throws made. </p><p><ins>Formula= Number of times plant species occurs </ins> <br>\nTotal number of quadrat throws made</p><p>Finally, divide the average frequency by the area of the quadrat =<br>\n<ins>Average Frequency </ins><br>\n Area of quadrat .</p>",

Without fertilization, it would be impossible to produce new organisms through sexual reproduction. Hence, it has erased the possibility of most organisms going into extinction because most offspring resemble their parents.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/93%203.jpg\" style=\"height:74px; width:400px\"><br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/93%2033.jpg\" style=\"height:161px; width:300px\"></p><p><strong>Reasons for the answer in (d)(i): </strong><br>\nIn F1 generation, all the numbers produced are heterozygous (dominant recessive) blue.
