Moneocious plants/Male and female flowers occur on the same plant in different position e.g. Maize/Luffa/Oil palm/coconut etc (male flower at the apex matures first whereas the female flower in the axil of leaves matures later) the feathery stigma hang loosely and can catch airborne pollen grains but not from the same flower.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong>: Most flowers are so structured as to prevent self pollination since only a particular insect/animal can effect pollination; e.g. Crotalaria/CentrocemaNigna/pea/groundnut- stamens mature first shedding pollen into a sac-like tube formed by the keel honey guides on the standard which direct the bee to the sectaries and the stigma points towards entrance of keel and can only receive pollen brought in by a visiting bee. Self-incompatibility/self-sterility (certain chemicals on the surface of the stigma prevent growth in pollen tubes; of pollen grains from the same flower) e.g. Clover. Possession of brightly coloured petals attract insects e.g. Delonix, Hibiscus.
