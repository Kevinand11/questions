        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) Short notes: </strong><br>\n(i) <strong>Niche</strong>: Refers to a specific portion of a habitat/dwelling place which is occupied by a particular species of organism. It is also a functional position/role of an organism within the community. Each organism living in the same habitat has its own living space, source of food and tolerance for the effect of the habitat/environment.</p><p><strong>(ii) Population density:</strong> It is the number of individual organisms of the same species. Per unit area/volume of the habitat at a particular time. It determines the interaction between members of the same species and members of other species. It is mathematically expressed as Total <ins>population/population size. </ins>      It is estimated in humans/animals by counting. In plants by using quadrat.<br>\n         Area of habitat</p><p><strong>(iii) Climax community: </strong>Is established when a stable/ unchanging community is attained in ecological succession. The community is in equilibrium with the environment. The vegetation reaches its highest development. The same species of animals, plants/organism re-occur from year to year.</p><p><strong>(b) Interaction between biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem: </strong>In an ecosystem the abiotic factors are non-living things (carbondioxide, oxygen, sunlight, soil and water, etc) while the biotic components are plants and animals. Green plants use carbondioxide in the presence of sunlight to produce carbonhydrate/ starch/food. Animals/herbivores feed on carbonhydrate/ plants and release carbondioxide from respiration. Decomposers break down dead plants/animals/organic matters to release nutrients to the soil. These nutrients are absorbed by plants for use in food production/ photosynthesis. Plants give out oxygen during photosynthesis, which is used by animals for respiration.</p>",
