        "answer": "<p>(a) A sense organ is a group of specialised cells or tissues and receptors, which is able to receive or collect, perceive and detect stimulus and transmit the information; impulse and message to the central nervous system.</p><p><strong>(b)(i)Two main functions of the ear are:</strong><br>\nHearing and maintenance of balance.</p><p><strong>(ii) The mechanism involved in hearing are; </strong></p><ol>\n<li><strong>The pinna;</strong> collects sound waves in the air, concentrates them and passes them on through the external auditor) canal or meatus.</li>\n<li><strong>The waves;</strong> cause the tympanic membrane or ear drum to vibrate. The vibrations are passed on to the ear ossicles (mallens, inclus and stapes) which amplify them.</li>\n<li><strong>The round oval window; </strong>fenestral oval is rotunda also vibrates, passing the waves into the cavity of the inner ear, cochlea, where the perilymph vibrates, transmits the waves in the cochlea which also causes the endolymph of the cochlea to vibrate.

The end of the branch is then tied to a firm support. A ring of bark has to be removed from the part of the branch touching the soil while a slit is made half way through the branch. Then this part has to be pushed below the soil and cover with soil while a heavy object is placed on the heap of the soil to weigh it down, e.g., Bougainvillea, Rose plant (sp) cocoa, coffee.</p><p>(vii) Marcoting, e.g. mango, lemon (citrus), Rose (Rosa sp)</p><p><strong>(b)(i) Advantages of Vegetative propagation are: </strong></p><ul>\n<li>young plant uses food reserves of the parent as it becomes established or easily established.</li>\n<li>Growth in young plant is rapid since there is no resting or lag period</li>\n<li>Only one parent is needed</li>\n<li>desirable characters are retained</li>\n<li>offspring is identical to parent</li>\n<li>offspring matures more rapidly</li>\n<li>are less susceptible to adverse weather conditions</li>\n<li>plants that do not produce seeds can only be [propagated vegetatively)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>(ii) Disadvantages of vegetative propagation are: </strong></p><ul>\n<li>No new varieties are produced; no mixing of characters</li>\n<li>offspring and parents compete for light and nutrients since many individuals occupy a limited area of land</li>\n<li>overcrowding; reduces resistance to disease</li>\n<li>reduces resistance to changes in climate / adaptation to environment. </li>\n<li>colonisation of new localities unlikely, since offspring is always produced close to parent plant</li>\n<li>diseases of parents will be transmitted to offspring</li>\n<li>undesirable features are easily transmitted to offspring. <br>\n </li>\n</ul>",

        "question": "<p>(a) List five classes of food other than carbohydrates.</p><p>(b) Explain why glucose is taken by an athlete ready for a race rather than corn meal.</p><p>(c) Describe the test for starch.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Classes of food other than carbohydrates are: protein, fats and oils / lipids, water, vitamins, mineral salts.</p><p><strong>(b) The reasons why glucose is taken by an athlete before a race are:</strong> glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrate, i.e. soluble form of cabohydrate; which does not require any form of digestion. Hence, it is absorbed in the ileum, small intestine, where it diffuses and enters into the blood stream, circulatory system. It is then assimilated and oxidized; within the shortest time to give energy to the athlete. But corn meal is a complex carbohydrate, polysaccharide, starch, which will require series of carbohydrate / hyrolysis, starting from the mouth and later in the duodenum. Due to the processes, carbohydrate has to pass through it to the small intestine, ileum, which takes a longer time to produce energy for use, i.e cannot give immediate energy.</p><p>(c) To test for starch, obtain tuber of yam, cassava, potato, sweet potato, maize, cereal or any starchy food and macerate (crush). Then, add water to the mash to prepare starch solution; put a few drops of the starch (mashed material or a bit of the macerate on a white tile) test tube or watch glass. Add one to two drops of iodine and the material or solution will turn blue black, or black indicating presence of starch.</p>",

Some cells are capable of independent existence, carrying out all the characteristics or life processes in living things. They may have processes like pseudopodia, cilia, flagella, etc. Cells also have inclusions, referred to as organales.</p><p><strong>A tissue</strong> is a collection of cells which are similar in structure and perform similar functions. Some tissues cannot exist on their own but some can live on their own, e.a., Hydra. They have the same origin and occupy the same position in the body of the organism.</p><p><strong>An organ </strong>is a collection of different tissues that perform a common function or functions. Some organs carry out a single function. e.g., heart while others carry our more than one function, e.g., kidney.</p><p><strong>A system;</strong> is made up of different organs that perform a particular function.

        "answer": "<p>(a) Osmosis is the process by which water molecules or solvent move from area or region of weaker solution through a semi-permeable membrane.

Continuous gain or absorption of water by the red blood cell makes the cell swell or enlarge in size and eventually burst. Hence hemolyses or heamolysis takes place.</p><p><strong>(b (ii) Three conditions that may cause heamolysis are: </strong><br>\n(1) disease attack<br>\n(2) abuse or use of drugs and food<br>\n(3) poisoning<br>\n(4) infection/ epidemic<br>\n(5) industrial activities/ pollution. <br>\n </p>",
