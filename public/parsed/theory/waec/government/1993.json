        "question": "<p>(a)Differentiate between legal sovereignty and political sovereignty.</p><p>(b) What factors limit the sovereignty of a government? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The other name for political sovereignty is popular sovereignty and it is the supreme power of the people to decide the type of government they desire. This decision of the people is exercised through the ballot. It gives them a free hand to decide those capable of representing them in government by transfering the powers they have to them. Legal sovereignty on the other hand is the power exercised by a body in a state. This body is the Parliament. The parliament only has the power to make laws. So, legal sovereignty is with the Parliament. The parliament also has the power to amend the constitution.</p><p><em><strong>(b). Factors that limit the Sovereignty of a Government include: </strong></em></p><p>(i) <em><strong>The constitution:</strong></em> The supremacy of the constitution makes it possible for all institutions in the state to have their powers limited by the constitution. The law of the land should be above everybody in a state.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Membership of international organisation: </em></strong>As long as countries belong to international organisations, e.g. U.N.O., 0.A.U., ECOWAS, limitations are.placed on the sovereignty of these countries. It is incumbent on them to abide by the policies of these organisations and rules governing them.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Public opinion: </em></strong>Public opinion has the capacity to check and control the excesses of the powers of government.</p><p>(iv)<strong><em> International laws:</em></strong> States have to abide by international laws and conventions. So these laws place limitations on the sovereignty of states.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Foreign aids: </em></strong>Some poor nations of the world receive aids e.g. military, economic aids etc. of different types from developed countries, It is possible for these donor countries to dictate the economic policies of these poor countries.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>The influence of super powers:</em></strong> The West or the East has very strong influence over weaker or smaller countries. The external policies of these weak and small countries are made in line with the influence of these super powers.</p><p>(vii) <em><strong>The Military take-over of government: </strong></em>This tends to limit the sovereignty of states. The suspension of the constitution after forceful take-over of power affects the location of sovereignty in a state.</p><p>(viii) <em><strong>Delegation of power in modern government:</strong></em> In modern states, powers are transferred or delegated to some other bodies or organisations. For example, the transfer of lawmaking from parliament to other bodies, e.g. NEPA, limits the sovereign power of the parliament. <br>\n </p>",

This is because wrong and unqualified hands have been appointed.</p><p>(iii)<strong><em> Political interference:</em></strong> Political interference in public corporations may produce inefficiency.

        "answer": "<p><strong><em>The Rule of law presupposes that all men are equal before the law, but in practice, this is not always true. This can be confirmed by considering the following points: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <strong><em>Immunity of the Head of state: </em></strong>Some powers conferred and exercised by Heads of states make equality before the law impossible.</p><p>(ii)<strong><em> Brutality by the law enforcement agents: </em></strong>In some countries, the law enforcement agents (e.g. the police) arrest, torture and detain citizens indiscriminately. This is contrary to the concept of the rule of law which demands that citizens should have the right to a fair hearing and that only the courts have the final say about the offence committed by the individual.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Diplomatic immunity:</em></strong> Diplomats representing their countries in different parts of the world cannot be prosecuted in the countries where they are serving, but can be repatriated. This is a negation of the rule of law.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Parliamentary immunity: </em></strong>Members of the parliament cannot be sued or prosecuted. They have immunity. Actions or statements inimical to the law of the state, made in the House or. Parliament may not attract any legal action against them. In this wise, they are not equal with other citizens before the law.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Type of government: </em></strong>A one party state is known to operate with laws inimical to the rule of law. The Head of state may have the power to arrest or detain citizens even without trial.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Official misuse of powers:</strong></em> Some government officials may possess extra powers needed to execute most of their functions effectively. In the process, most of them, have misused such powers given them. This undermines the application of the rule of law.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Customs and traditions:</em></strong> In an attempt to respect the customs and traditions of the people, equality for all may be abused.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>Economic wealth: </em></strong>Some individuals with enormous economic wealth can circumvent or use their positions to make equality before the law unworkable, Also, they can use such powers to influence justice.</p><p>(ix). <strong><em>Corruption</em></strong>: Absence of honest and impartial judiciary may make nonsense of the equality before the law.</p><p>(x).
