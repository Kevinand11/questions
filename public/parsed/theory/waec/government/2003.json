        "question": "<p>What is government as an academic field of study? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Government is one of the social science subjects taught in schools. In tertiary institutions, it is called political science, because it studies political institutions. Its study includes such courses as political theory, public administration, political behaviour, international relations, comparative government, politics and political thought. It also looks into political institutions and processes in the state. In contemporary time, it has assumed the status of science, in which state of the art, instructional technologies like the computer, basic research, statistics and analysis of data are used to achieve more systematic study of the subject. Its study has come up with different methods and techniques to achieve systematic propositions which are being used for solving problems that con-front various governmental systems. In ensuring in-depth study, the subject has evolved an inter-disciplinary perspective by borrowing from or relating with several other subjects as economics, mathematics, sociology, psychol-ogy, philosophy, etc.<br>\n </p>",

Voters who supported the less successful candidates are able to switch their support to either of the two leading candidates until a candidate secures the majority votes and wins. It is also known as \" run-off.-election\".</p><p>(d) The alternative vote is another electoral system designed to secure majority representation of the electorate. Under the system, voters are issued ballot papers in which they must indicate their preferences in order of importance, by marking 1, 2, 3, etc. The candidates with the least preference are repeatedly knocked out until a winner emerges.<br>\n </p>",
