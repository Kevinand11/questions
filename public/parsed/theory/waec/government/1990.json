        "question": "<p>  (a)Differentiate between constitution and constitutionalism.</p><p>(b) What are the characteristics of a constitutional government?<br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)</strong> A constitution could be defined as the fundamental laws customs, conventions, rules and regulations stipulating how a country is governed. The constitution also explains the working of the organs of government, the functions of the government functionaries and the rights, duties and obligations of its citizens. The term constitutionalism refers to a limited government. It means that the power of government should be defined and limited by the laws of the land as embodied in the constitution. The activities and functions of those in government should conform with the provisions of the constitution. The constitution, therefore, has succeeded in describing the different organs of government, their functions and how they relate to one another . Constitutionalism as a principle is not a constitution but only puts limitation to the activities of individuals and the government etc. This principle also empowers the judiciary to declare illegal or unconstitutional actions of those in government that contradict with the provisions of the constitution. Individuals also can challenge any actions of government seen as unconstitutional in courts.</p><p><strong><em>(b) Characteristics of a Constitutional Government:</em></strong></p><p>(1) There must be independent and impartial judiciary.</p><p>(ii) The Fundamental Human Rights must be recognised and protected.</p><p>(iii) There is the existence of party systems e.g two-party, multi-party systems.</p><p>(iv) Everybody should be equal before the law.</p><p>(iv)The application of the principles of separation of powers.</p><p>(v) Citizens have equal political rights to vote and be voted for in any political election.</p><p>(vii) There should be freedom of the press, no censorship.</p><p>(viii) The procedure for changing government should be entrenched in the constitution.</p><p>(ix) There should be the application of the rule of law as contained in the constitution. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p> (a) Explain the concept of the Rule of law.</p><p>(b) What are the problems associated with the application of the concept? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The Rule of Law is defined as the predominance and supremacy of law as enunciated by the constitution. The law is supreme over the political leaders in government and the people making up the system as well. Everybody in a defined political system should be subject to the laws of the land. Professor A.V. Dicey, in his book, \"Introduction to the law of the Constitution,\" argued that the political leaders entrusted with the governance of the country should do so in line with the agreed laws of the land. They should see the laws as the number one important issue in a country and must see the need to respect and abide by every provision of the constitution. Failure of such governments to respect the provisions of the constitution may result in an arbitrary government. In addition, Dicey's book also stressed the need for equality before the law, irrespective of one's social, economic and political standing. He also stated that no individual should be punished without being given a fair trial in the law courts. Similarly, the rights of individuals should not be denied them. Every government should guarantee such rights to the citizens.</p><p><strong><em>(b) The following are the problems associated with the application of the Rule of Law:</em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Absence of the independence of the judiciary:</strong></em> If the independence of the judiciary is not in place, the application of the rule of law could be defective.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>State of emergency:</em></strong> This may result if a country is passing through crises and when this is imposed,the rights of the citizens are denied them. State of emergency in a country, may give more powers to the government, even to arrest and detain citizens without a possible trial in courts. It is a period that people detest so much.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Type of party-system: </em></strong>A system of government practised in a country e.g. one-party system may produce a dictatorial government and this can affect a smooth application of the rule of law.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>The military in government:</em></strong> The role of the military in government is seen as defective. It does not rule the people with a constitution. The laws of the country are not respected and even the Judiciary is not given a free hand to adjudicate and interpret the laws of the land freely. This is also a problem associated with the concept of the rule of law.</p><p>(v) <em><strong>Setting up of Tribunals:</strong></em> It administers cases differently from constitutional courts. Appeal Cases are not entertained, making it to work contrary to the laws of the land.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Diplomatic immunity:</strong></em> According to international laws and convention, diplomats are not prosecuted in the countries where they are representing their countries. This is a limitation to the application of the rule of law.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Parliamentary immunity:</em></strong> Law-makers cannot be prosecuted based on any negative happenings on the floor of the parliament. Such actions in parliament are problems to the workings of the rule of law.</p><p>(viii) <em><strong>Delegated legislation:</strong></em> Laws made at times by some of these bodies e.g. NEPA violate the principles of separation of powers and rule of law.</p><p>(ix) Unlawful detention, arrest and torture, by the law enforcement agents e.g. the police are problems to the application of the rule of law.</p><p>(x) <strong><em>Illiteracy, Ignorance and poverty:</em></strong> These three ills in the society, prevent citizens of a country from knowing and even taking the necessary actions against the denials of their rights.</p><p>(xi) <strong><em>Customs and Traditions:</em></strong> Respect to customs and traditions of the people of a country may result in violations of the rule of law.<br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>Why do some West African countries adopt the Unitary\" system of government while others do not? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong><em>The following are reasons why some West African countries adopt the unitary system of government while others do not: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Tribal differences:</strong></em> Unitary system of government is best practised in a country where people are homogenous in character and there are no sharp differences in religion, race, language, etc.</p><p>(ii)<strong><em> Size of the country: </em></strong>It is best practised in a small country. For e.g Ghana, Benin Republic, etc.</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>Loyalty to the central government: </strong></em>Unitary system works in a country where the citizens show loyalty to the central government.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>No fear of domination: </em></strong>If different sections of the country do not have to entertain any form of fear of domination, unitary is a better option for them.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Common language and culture:</em></strong> These factors can give rise to the adoption of a unitary state. The reason is that the people see one another as of one identity and no division among them.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Absence of Minority groups:</strong></em> A country where the issue of minority is not in question, unitary system can work well there.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Not-too-defined economic inequalities:</em></strong> This has the capacity of removing fears of economic exploitation and domination and unitary option will work very well in such a system.<br>\n </p>",
