        "answer": "<p>Government as an institution of the state is a machinery through which the will of the state is formulated, expressed and realised. Government in addition performs the following functions:</p><p>(I) <em><strong>Law-making:</strong></em> This is one of the functions and it includes execution.</p><p>(ii) <em><strong>Defence of the country: </strong></em>The essence of the armed forces (army, navy, air force) is to defend the country against external aggression and sustaining the territorial integrity of the state.</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>Maintenance of law and order: </strong></em>This is basically the functions of the police and law courts.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Administration of Justice:</em></strong> The law courts interpret the law and administer justice. Cases are treated according to their merits. The law courts can also punish offenders.</p><p>(v)<strong><em> Provision of social services:</em></strong> Provision of social amenities are basic functions of the government. Such amenities like pipe borne water, hospitals, electricity, roads, are however provided from the taxes the people pay.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>Protection of lives and property:</em></strong> It is the duty of the government to protect lives and property of the citizens living in the country.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Provision of Job opportunities: </em></strong>Government should provide employment opportunities for its citizens. Some countries like Britain pay the citizens unemployment allowance.</p><p>(viii)<strong><em>Economic Function:</em></strong> Government has the responsibility of promoting and regulating economic activities in order to enhance growth and the atmosphere for investment.</p><p>(ix) <em><strong>Political functions: </strong></em>Government is involved here through the setting up of an external body to conduct elections leading to a peaceful change of government. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p> What is a Federal State? What are the problems usually associated with a Federal system of government? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) A federal state is one in which powers of a state are constitutionally shared between the central government and the subordinate units e.g. states, local governments, etc. This power sharing has succeeded in making each level of government independent and autonomous.</p><p><em><strong>(b) Problems usually associated with a Federal System of Government are: </strong></em></p><p>(1) <em><strong>It is costly to operate: </strong></em>In a federal state, the duplication of offices has made it to be costly in terms of materials and human resources.</p><p>(ii) <em><strong>Creation of Weak Centre: </strong></em>As a result of the division of power created by the constitution between the centre and the subordinate units, the central government tends to be weak. Again, the fact that people tend to show more loyalty to their states than the central government, gives the support to this claim. A weak centre can affect the foreign policy objectives of a state (country).</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>Inter-state friction:</strong></em> Federalism, as argued in some quarters, breed inter-state or regional friction. The reason is that there are differences in opinion among the component states involved in the power sharing exercise.</p><p>(iv)<strong><em> It breeds sectionalism; </em></strong>The division of a country into different areas brings regional or state consciousness as opposed to national consciousness. In Nigeria, for e.g. people tend to be more loyal to their states than to the nation.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Difficulty in taking quick decision:</em></strong> Before decisions are made in a federal state, it will require consulting the different actors involved. For e.g. matters that fall into the concurrent lists involve both the central and state governments.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>Fear of domination: </em></strong>The fear of domination of one or more groups may likely occur at the centre, even though, powers are legally shared.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Disparity in the level of development:</em></strong> Federalism creates the avenue for some states to develop faster than others. It is a fact that, some of these states are equally more endowed naturally than others.</p><p>(viii) <em><strong>It causes disunity: </strong></em>In Nigeria, for e.g. where loyalty to one's own tribe is the order of the day, disunity may result.</p><p>(ix)<em><strong> It stimulates secession:</strong></em> The fear of domination among different ethnic groups and other problems of federalism may encourage the deprived ones to secede.</p><p>(x) <strong><em>Unhealthy rivalry: </em></strong>Unhealthy rivalry is one of the evils of federalism and it can lead to waste of time and IL even resources. This rivalry could be among the different tiers of government, ethnic groups and can even lead to hatred and disharmony.</p><p>(xi) <em><strong>Problem of Revenue allocation: </strong></em>It creates the problem of sharing the wealth or the money coming into the federation account, between the central government and the component units e.g. states, local government, etc.</p><p>(xii)<strong><em> Difficulty in amending the constitution: </em></strong>A federal constitution is rigid and does not suit the emergency period as well as the changing economic, social and political events of the country.</p><p>(xiii)<strong><em> Conflict in the exercise of functions:</em></strong> Tension could generate between the central and component states or units on the exercise of functions, allocated to them by the constitution. e.g. functions that fall within the concurrent lists.</p><p>(xiv) <strong><em>Dual loyalty: </em></strong>In a federalism, where two different governments are in place, people tend to demonstrate their loyalty first to their state and then the central government.</p><p>(xv) <strong><em>Enhancement of mediocrity:</em></strong> Federalism admits equal participation of citizens especially at the central level of government, enlistment of men and women into the S. armed forces, etc. In Nigeria, for example federal character is used thereby throwing merits to the dust bin.</p><p>(xvi) <strong><em>It causes census problems:</em></strong> Population in some cases determine the number of seats a state will have in the legislature. Nigeria, for example is a country with many tribes and languages, each component unit may want to inflate its figures in order to secure more seats. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>  Explain the French policies of Assimilation and Association. <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><em><strong> The Policy of Assimilation:</strong></em> This was the policy of administration that the French adopted in administering its colonies in West Africa. The French design was to impose her culture, law, language, etc., on West Africans. Originally, France had the belief that her culture and civilization are superior and so would want to embark on civilising the people of West Africa. After achieving this, West African territories were then seen as an extension of the French civilization. Some people or areas within the French federation were made French citizens, giving them the opportunities to enjoy legal rights, education and other privileges. Those people not defined as citizens were made non-citizens or subjects and cannot enjoy these rights and privileges. </p><p><strong><em>The Policy of Association:</em></strong> The obnoxious policy of Assimilation gave way to the policy of Association. This new policy as advocated, recognised the traditional institutions, political institutions, as well as, the culture, customs and traditions of the people, in the colonies. Similarly, the former division of Africans into two citizens (citizens and non-citizens) was abolished. Also, the indignant policy, forced labour, etc., were as well abolished. This was done by the French authorities to create more avenues for co-operation. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><em><strong>The Action Group (AG): </strong></em>A group of Yoruba students studying in Britain came together in 1945 and formed a cultural group called Egbe Omo Oduduwa. It later metamorphosed and became known as Action Group (AG) in March 1951. The founder and leader was the Late Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Other notable and influential members of the party were S.L. Akintola, Chief Shonibare, Chief Bode Thomas, the Late Oni of Ife, Sir Adesoji Aderemi, etc.</p><p><em><strong>The Northern People's Congress (NPC): </strong></em>This congress was formed in October 1951 and it was formally called the Jamiyyar Mutanem Arewa (cultural organisation) founded in December 1949. The Northern People's Congress was mainly dominated by Hausa/Fulani stock and based on Islamic religious belief. The leader was the Late Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, the Sarduana of Sokoto. He was seen as both religious and traditional leader. The NPC, as a party, was firmly established and the support it had from the people was because Islam demands obedience to constituted authority and NPC was firmly established on Islamic principles.</p><p><em><strong>Aims of NPC:</strong></em></p><p>(a) To work towards enhancing or promoting the social, economic and political development of the people and Northern region as a whole.</p><p>(b) To work towards making the North autonomous, and create understanding among the people.</p><p>(c) To educate the people on their political and civil rights.</p><p><em><strong>The National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroun (NCNC):</strong></em> This party was formed in August 1944 and the first President was Herbert Macaulay while Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the Secretary General. The National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroun (NCNC) had the name changed to National Congress or Convention of Nigerian Citizens. This was because in 1960 Cameroun left Nigeria. This party was more of a national party, based on the composition and the organisation. One of its major aims was for a total decolonization of Nigeria<br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong><em>The following reasons were responsible for the military incursion into Nigerian politics in 1966: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Politicization of the army: </strong></em>The army was highly politicised. Promotion was no more based on merits, but the issue of tribe and politics played a vital role in this regard. Politicians had to use the army to achieve selfish ends.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Political parties were regionalised:</em></strong> One of the reasons claimed by the military for a take-over of government was regionally based political parties. For e.g. NCNC for the Eastern region, NPC for the North and A.G. for the West. Recognition and support for the parties were obtained from the ethnic groups based in the regions. It should be of note that none of the parties had a national support.</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>Mismanagement of the economy: </strong></em>Civilians were accused of messing up the economy of the country. Projects that were not viable were embarked upon, making it possible for avenues of money-making to come to light and at the same time jeopardising the economy of the country. The army claimed to have come in to remedy the wrongs committed by the civilian government.</p><p>(iv) <em><strong>Bad and ill-conceived administration: </strong></em>Bad administration coupled with bad leadership of the first Republic was one of the factors for the military intervention.</p><p>(v)<em><strong> Corruption, tribalism, nepotism; </strong></em>There was the allegation of mass looting of public fund Wealth was acquired illegally and tribalism and nepotism played key roles in appointments, promotion of civil servants, etc.</p><p>(vi)<em><strong> Influence of some foreign powers; </strong></em>It was alleged that most of the coups that took place in Africa, including Nigeria, had some foreign connections. This is done because most of these foreign powers would want a government that they can manipulate to their own advantage. Most African coups also influenced that of Nigeria e.g. the 1963 January 13 coup in Togo in which President Sylvanus Olympio was assassinated, Egypt in 1952 when Colonel Abdel Nasser removed King Farouk from power.</p><p>(vii) <em><strong>Competition among ethnic groups:</strong></em> This was made possible especially when the politics of the first Republic was seen as one of ethnicity. This therefore, produced unhealthy rivalry among the three major tribes as to which would dominate or control the centre. The army was attracted to halt this trend which can break the country apart. <br>\n </p>",
