        "answer": "<p><strong><em>Reasons for the adoption of Bicameral Legislature by some countries are:</em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Acts as a check: </strong></em>Bicameral legislature makes for two chambers of law making. The positive side of this is that one chamber can check against hasty passing of a law.</p><p>(ii) Equal representation of the component units making up a federal system is achieved with the presence of a second chamber.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Nomination</em></strong>: In some countries people with good track records are nominated into the second chamber. The provision of a bicameral legislature is an opportunity for these respected individuals to serve their country. In Britain, members of the House of Lords are nominated.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Increased participation: </em></strong>Bicameral legislature makes it possible for more people to participate in politics especially in the law making process.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Tyranny:</em></strong> The tyranny of a single chamber is out of place in this system.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>Reduction of Work load:</em></strong> The work load of the lower house is drastically reduced in this system, e.g House of Lords is responsible for some major appointments and ratification of some treaties.</p><p>(vii)<strong><em> Check on the executive: </em></strong>Effective check is provided on the executive more than what obtains in one chamber. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Explain the political concept of legitimacy</p><p>(b) What are the factors that sustain legitimacy in a state? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Legitimacy is a political concept which has to do with the citizens' approval, acceptance and recognition of the rights of their political leaders to govern. A government is considered legitimate if it comes to power not through coup or appointments, but through constitutional means. Therefore, elected governments are legitimate. However, it is argued in some quarters that the military in government may attain legitimacy if popular policies are made by it.</p><p><strong><em>(b) Factors that can sustain Legitimacy are: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <strong><em>Good Stable government:</em></strong> If the government policies are good, the people will continue to have trust and confidence in such governments, for example in the areas of providing social amenities and infrastructure, maintenance of law and order, obeying the provisions of the constitution, etc.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Reliable leadership: </em></strong>Legitimacy may be ascribed to a leader that performs creditably in office.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Periodic elections:</em></strong> Free and fair elections produce legitimacy. Periodic elections will help to keep it alive.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Broad based political participation:</em></strong> If political appointments cut across sections of the society, this can strengthen legitimacy in such systems.</p><p>(v)<em><strong> Regard for customs and traditions: </strong></em>If the government regards customs and traditions of the people, legitimacy could be sustained, for e.g. heredity is maintained in Benin Monarch, British Monarch , etc.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Ideology </strong></em>: If the ruling government upholds the principle of the state ideology, this can help to sustain legitimacy, e.g Capitalism in U.S.A. <br>\n </p>",

Executive powers belonged to the Oba while the Chiefs exercised legislative powers.</p><p>(vi) The issue of checks and balances played a major role in enforcing order in the performance of the separated functions, e.g the Ogboni society was a check on the powers of the oba.</p><p>(vii) The Kingmakers, acting on the will of the people, could remove any erring Oba. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong><em>Reasons why it has been difficult for many African countries to Implement the principle of non-alignment are: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Underdeveloped Economy: </strong></em>Most of the countries in Africa have economies that are underdeveloped. Assist-ance is therefore needed from the two power blocs, for example, in the area of transfer of technology.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Unstable political system: </em></strong>Unstable political system manifesting in some African states had compelled them to look for military aids from the power blocs - East or West.</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>Indebtedness</strong></em>: Many of the countries in Africa are indebted in one way or the other to the Eastern or Western blocs.</p><p>(iv) <em><strong>Economic dependence: </strong></em>Most of the manufactured goods found in African countries are imported. The reason is because most of these African countries are mainly primary producers.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>International Organisations:</em></strong> Many African countries are members of some international organisations tied to the blocs, e.g the Commonwealth, which is tied to the western bloc.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Colonial influence: </strong></em>There is the influence of colonialism in subjecting some African countries to follow or conform to the policies of their erstwhile colonial masters.</p><p>(vii)<strong><em> Fear of external aggression:</em></strong> The fear of external aggression nursed by some African countries makes them to turn to either the western or eastern blocs, for the necessary military assistance.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>Selfish ambition of some African Leaders: </em></strong>This has to do with sit-tight political leaders who refuse to abdicate their positions because of the support they are getting from either of the blocs. Some of them have even sold their nations to these power blocs, making them puppets in their hands, e.g. the late Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong><em> Problems facing the Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAS) are: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <strong><em>Unstable political System : </em></strong>Change of government has been a recurring phenomenon in West Africa. Almost all the member states have experienced military intervention in their political system. This is very unhealthy because attention is drawn away from the development of the country, issues of international dimension, etc, to spending money on personal security, internal security and stability.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Language and Cultural barrier: </em></strong>West Africa as a whole has no common identified language, thereby creating a barrier to the achievement of the organisation's set- goals.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Differences in Ideology: </em></strong>Individual member nations' ideological stance can affect the objectives of the organisation . There is the tendency for each state to be influenced by this ideology in determining its seriousness in pursuance of the objectives of the sub-regional body.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Problem of finance: </em></strong>To be able to develop and implement some of their projects, member states of the sub-region resort to foreign aids and loans. It means that much revenue accruing to these states will be spent in financing these loans. The problem then is that ECOWAS cannot carry out most of its beautiful programmes because of the inability of member-states to pay their dues to the organisation.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Fear of domination: </em></strong>The less-developed or poor nations in the region have the fear of being dominated by the richer or developing nations.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>Criminal activities:</em></strong> Most of the citizens of the countries that form the organisation indulge in currency trafficking , smuggling, etc, even across the borders of the sub-region.</p><p>(vii) Disasters like famine, drought, wars, coups, etc, have led to the problem of refugees in West Africa.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>Hostility within the Sub-region: </em></strong>Some member states accuse others of aiding coups in their countries as well as interfering in their domestic or internal affairs. This kind of hostility may result in the closure of borders.</p><p>(ix) <strong><em>Poor Communication network:</em></strong> Roads, telephones, railways, etc, are in poor state and cannot produce the desired results.</p><p>(x)<strong><em> Non-Similarity in Currency:</em></strong> Inability of the member states to harmonize their currencies can affect the goal of the organisation. Nothing can be achieved when individual member -state's currency is maintained.</p><p>(xi) <strong><em>Similarity of products:</em></strong> As long as most of the goods produced in member states are similar, volume of trade will be affected or reduced drastically.</p><p>(xii) <strong><em>Smaller economic groupings:</em></strong> As long as other economic groups exist in the French speaking countries, e.g communate economique L'Quest (C.E.A.Q), etc, along side ECOWAS, loyalty of member states to this sub-regional body will be reduced<br>\n </p>",
