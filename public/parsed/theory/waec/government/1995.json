        "answer": "<p><strong><em>(a)Functions of Public Corporation include:</em></strong></p><p>(i) Provision of essential services, e.g water, electricity.</p><p>(ii) to generate and provide employment for the citizens.</p><p>(iii) provision of some services that are capital intensive which ordinarily cannot be provided by individuals e.g electricity, railways, etc.</p><p>(iv) to remove the tendency to exploit the people if individuals were to handle such essential services.</p><p>(v) to be involved in the provision of some strategic projects and mainly for security reasons e.g arms manufacturing, minting, etc.</p><p>(vi)To be involved in revenue generation for the government, for e.g. NICON.</p><p><strong><em>(b) Problems of Public Corporation are as follows:</em></strong></p><p>(i)<strong><em> Frequent change of government: </em></strong>This can affect the efficiency of public corporation. It can produce or result in frequent and unreasonable changes of officials and this can affect the efficient performance of some of the public corporations</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Victimization :</em></strong> There could be political victimiza-tion of officials of public corporation especially if the officials are not ready to dance to the tune of the party in government.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Inadequate qualified personnel :</em></strong> Most qualified technicians and professionals may not join any of the corporations probably as a result of poor conditions of service</p><p>(iv) <em><strong>Poor attitude to Work:</strong></em> Most of the workers display ' I don't care attitude', to work. They see the corporations as belonging to nobody and so poor attitude to work is the result.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Red-Tapism/ Bureaucracy:</em></strong> People accuse public corporations of too much adherence to protocols or official issues.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>Frequent political interference:</em></strong> This interference may come from the executive or legislative arms of government and this may affect the efficiency of public corporations.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Sectionalism and Nepotism: </em></strong>The ugly sides of these two monsters can affect the efficiency of public corpora-tions.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>Ethnicity/ Favouritism: </em></strong>Both are playing major role in appointments of Board of Directors, Managing Directors and even General Managers to control public corporations.</p><p>9. <em><strong>Inefficiency</strong></em>: Inefficiency is the bane of most public corporations. They perform poorly and below expectation, for example, NEPA, Water Corporations, NRC, etc.</p><p>(x) <em><strong>Monopoly: </strong></em>Most of the public Corporations e.g NEPA, Water Corporation, etc, enjoy monopoly and some forms of protections from the state. In modern states, efficiency results from competition, inefficiency may result from monopoly, because of the absence of competition.</p><p>(xi) <strong><em>Delay in policy making and execution: </em></strong>This may come up because those involved in policy making and execution are many.</p><p>(xii) Wastages: Most public Corporations are accused of wastages and carelessness.</p><p>(xiii) <strong><em>Inability to generate enough fund for the government:</em></strong> The idea that public Corporations were mainly established to provide essential services to the people may not be fully true after all. This is because government may want them to generate enough fund from within in order to stay afloat and not to depend wholly on government subvention. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong><em>Factors that necessitated the adoption of Nigerian Federalism are as follows: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Differences in ethnic Composition:</strong></em> There are differences in traditions, culture, language, religion, etc. These differences exist among the different ethnic groups, hence the adoption of federalism in Nigeria.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Fear of ethnic domination: </em></strong>The fear of one major ethnic group dominating others may give rise to the adoption of federalism.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Size of Country: </em></strong>Nigeria has a large population and with a wide geographical expression, federalism is a better option.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Minority interest: </em></strong>Adoption of federalism in Nigeria, is one way of protecting the interests of the minority. Nigeria has both the majority and minority tribes and other diversified interests and groups.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Geographical Contiguity: </em></strong>The geographical nearness of the people in the country gave rise to the adoption of federalism.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Even development:</strong></em> Federalism promotes quick and even development and this is one of the reasons why Nigeria embraced it.</p><p>(vii) <em><strong>For security purposes:</strong></em> Different sovereign states may decide to come together by adopting federalism and this is done to have a secured sovereign state, for example, U.S. A., Switzerland, etc.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>To generate Employment opportunities:</em></strong> Federal system makes for duplication of functions, thereby generating employment opportunities in the process.</p><p>(ix) <strong><em>Desire for a Union: </em></strong>There was the desire among the various groups to come together and form a union. This will remove all fears of external aggression.</p><p>(x) <em><strong>To bring government nearer to the people: </strong></em>Federalism may give rise to the creation of other units of government e.g states, local governments etc. This will help to bring the government nearer to the people.</p><p>(xi) <em><strong>Prevents inequalities :</strong></em> Federalism prevents inequalities among different groups. It removes the tendency of one or more groups becoming more powerful than the others.</p><p>(xii) <strong><em>Enhancement of the autonomy of States: </em></strong>This is only possible in federalism. In unitary state, autonomy is not granted component units e.g states, local governments.</p><p>(xiii) <strong><em>Expansion of Local Markets:</em></strong> Federalism creates the opportunity for the expansion of local markets.</p><p>(xiv) <strong><em>For effective administration:</em></strong> Duplication of functions which is allowed in a federal set up, makes for effective administration.
