Now, Hamza is a pilot, Emeka is a businessman, Funsho is banker, Fejiro is a manufacturer while Idongesit is a teacher. State two ways by which any of these friends can apply ICT in their respective professions.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Application of ICT</p><p><strong>(i) As a Pilot;</strong> one can use ICT in the following areas; For storing all operations and communication on the flight into data recorder and a flight recorder or clack box so as to guide investigation if an accident occurs. With the use of ICT, flying has been made quite a safe mode of travel. ICT use in aviation extends to booking, scheduling, flight control, payments, radar operation, weight determination, balance of air craft, loading, communication to ground-based stations, instrument readings and display of warning signals, fire detection, engine performance monitoring, emergency operation, cargo tagging and tracking e.t.c.</p><p><strong>(ii) As a Businessman;</strong>- Standard office application, e.g MS Word, reports, e.t.c. Spreadsheets e.g MS Excel; for analysis of financial information, calculations, etc. Database software e.g Oracle Microsoft SQL server, Access, managing data in many forms etc. Presentation software e.g MS PowerPoint, etc. Graphics software e'g Adobe Photoshop, create and edit images such as logs, drawings or picturing. Specialist application. Accounting application.</p><p><strong>(iii) As a Banker;</strong> It is used for an Automated Teller Machine. Cashline Machine. For clearing cheques. For Electronic Transfer (ETF). Smart card.</p><p><strong>(iv) As a Manufacturer;</strong> It enhances automation. Smart Sensor System for processing and control and robotics within the food process chain. It enhances effective communication.</p><p><strong>(v) As a Teacher;</strong> It enables teachers to transform their teaching practices. It improves the nature through teaching. ICT use impact on students achievement. Lesson planning is crucial when using ICT. It is a tool that helps teachers create more leaner-centric leaning environment. It is used to support change and to support/extend existing teaching practices. For information presentation.</p>",

        "question": "<p>a. A secondary school has over twenty personal computers. The school management intends to connect all the computer in a network. Give four reasons that must have motivated the school management into connecting the computers together.</p><p>(b) List four network devices required to accomplish the task in 3(a).</p><p>(c) State one function each of any two of the devices listed in 3(b).</p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) Reasons that might motivate the school management into connecting the computers together are;</strong></p><p>- To enhance communication and availability of information.</p><p>- It allows for more convenient resource sharing</p><p>- It makes file sharing easier.</p><p>- It is highly flexible.</p><p>- It is an inexpensive system.</p><p>- It boosts storage capacity.</p><p>- It increases cost efficiency.</p><p><strong>(b) Network devices required to accomplish the task in 3(a)</strong></p><p>-Computer system.</p><p>-Network cable.</p><p>-Network Interface card.</p><p>-HUP.</p><p>-Switch.</p><p>-Router.</p><p>-Proxy server.</p><p>-Bridge.</p><p>-Firewall.</p><p>-Modem</p><p>(c) <strong>(a) Network cable;</strong> It is a device that enables a computer to be connected to the network.</p><p><strong>(b) Network Interface card;</strong> It controls the wired and wireless connections of a computer to exchange information with other computers. It connects the computer to a local data network. It enables computers to communicate with one another. It serves as a mediator for network and computers.</p><p><strong>(c) Hub;</strong> It is used to connect segments of a LAN. Connects multiple computers to other network devices together.</p><p><strong>(d) Switch;</strong> As access or OS1 layer2. For connecting multiple hosts. Forward a message to specific host.</p><p><strong>(e) Router;</strong> Connecting multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own network or other network. It forwards data packets towards their destination. It forwards the packets to the destination of the TTL value is O. It changes the destination IP address of data packages before forwarding them to an exit interface. It determines the best path based on the destination MAC address. It acts as an intersection between multiple IP networks.</p><p><strong>(f) Proxy Server;</strong> Verifies and forward incoming client request to other servers for further communication. Acts as intermediary between the web browser and the web server. Provides internal system security. Speeds up resource access. Applies policies for tracking organizational internet use or accessing employee progress. To by-pass special controls such as parental or security controls. To scan for viruses and malware. To circumvent regional restrictions.</p><p><strong>(g) Network Bridge;</strong> Connects two segments of a network together. Divides network into manageable sections.</p><p><strong>(h) Firewall;</strong> Protects networks or network devices. Filters packets. Filters incoming network and outgoing networks. Prevents network traffic. Inspects packets which is supposed to forward to determine whether they correspond to a desired template for traffic patterns.</p><p><strong>(i) Modem;</strong> Converts digital signals generated by the computer into analog signals. Modulates signals. Data compression. Error correction. Flow control.</p><p> </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)(i) Entities;-</strong> An entity is an object in the system that we want to model and store information about. Entities are usually recognizable concepts either concrete or abstract such as persons, places. things or events which have relevance to the database.</p><p><strong>(ii) Attribute (Characteristics);</strong> It is a database component such as a table. It is also seen as a database field, they describe the instances in the row of a database. OR It is a column or field in a database table.</p><p><strong>(iii) Relationships;</strong> A relationship in the context of database is a situation that exists between two relational database tables when one table has a foreign key that references the primary key to the other table. A relationship allows relational database to split and store data in different tables, while linking disparate data items.</p><p><strong>(b((i) Cardinality;</strong> This refers to the uniqueness of data values contained in a column. High cardinality means that the column contains a large percentage of totally unique values. Low cardinality means that the column contains alot of \"repeals\" in its data range.</p><p><strong>(ii) Three cardinality relationships in database management; </strong></p><p>I. One-to one (1:1) relationship</p><p>II. One-to-many (1-M) relationship</p><p>III. Many-to-many (M:M) relationship</p>",
