        "question": "<p>What are the instruments used by the Central Bank to control the supply of money in any economy? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The Central Bank uses certain instruments to control the supply of money in any economy. Such instruments are:</p><p><strong>(i) Open market operation:</strong> OMO involves the buying and selling of securities by the central bank in order to control the volume of money in the economy.</p><p><strong>(ii) Discount rate:</strong> This is also known as Bank Rate. It is the rate at which the central bank charges interest on commercial and other financial institutions for discounting bills of exchange or lending to commercial banks. If the central bank wants to curtail bank lending, it will raise its discount rate, thereby forcing other rates to rise. This will make lending unfavourable to the public, thereby reducing the volume of money in circulation. On the other hand, if the CBN wants to pump money into the economy, the discount rate will be reduced.</p><p><strong>(iii) Special directives:</strong> These are special directives given to the commercial banks and other financial institutions by the central bank as to the areas of priority which their lending activities should follow.</p><p><strong>(iv) Moral suasions:</strong> This is more or less an appeal to the commercial banks by the central bank to behave in certain ways.</p><p><strong>(v) Special deposits: </strong>The commercial banks are compelled by law to keep certain percentages of their deposits with the central bank. If this is high, it will reduce the volume of loans given to the public and vice versa.</p><p><strong>(vi) Cash ratio/Liquidity ratio:</strong> This is also known as cash reserve ratio or liquidity ratio. The Central bank uses this ratio to increase or decrease the volume of money in circulation in a country. Like other methods, if the central bank wants to increase the amount of money in circulation in the economy during a deflationary period, it will lower the ratio thereby expanding the lending abilities of commercial banks and vice versa.<br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)Fixed Cost of production is the sum of the cost of all the fixed inputs used in a production process. Fixed Costs do not change with the changing output in the short run. This means that no matter the level of production, they remain fixed. Example of this is cost of machinery, land etc. FC = TC — VC.</p><p>Variable Cost, on the other hand, is the sum of the cost of all the variable inputs of production. It includes the cost of labour, raw materials and any other item whose cost changes as output changes in the short-run. Therefore, the more goods and services produced, the higher they tend to be and vice versa. VC = TC — FC.</p><p>(b) The difference between marginal Cost and Marginal Revenue; is that marginal cost is the change in total cost as a result of a unit change in output. Marginal cost does not depend on fixed cost but on the variable cost. MC = change in  \\(\\frac{TC}  {Dq}\\)</p><p>On the other hand, Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue as a result of a change in quantity sold. MR = \\(\\frac{DTR} {Q}\\) </p><p>(c) Total Cost of production is the sum of all the fixed and the variable cost incurred during production process. This varies with the level of output. TC = FC + VC. Total revenue is the total amount of money earned by selling a given level of output. Total revenue may increase, remain constant or decrease with changes in price. TR = p x q</p><p>(d) Average Cost is the total cost (TC) divided by the Total Output (Q). It is the unit cost, i.e., \\(\\frac{TC} {Q}\\) = AC.<br>\nAverage Revenue is the unit price. It is the Total Revenue (TR) divided by the output (Q).<br>\n\\(\\frac{ TR} {Q}\\)- AR.  <br>\n </p>",

The size of such firm depends on the knowledge and experience needed for planning the operation.</p><p><strong>(iv) Technical nature of product/service:</strong> Firms providing personal services for customers are usually run as small enterprises, e.g. lawyers, accountants and bankers. Firms producing perishable agricultural goods tend to produce to satisfy only local markets.
