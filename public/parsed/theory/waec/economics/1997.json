        "answer": "<p>(a)Opportunity cost means the alternative forgone in order to satisfy a particular want. It refers to the satisfaction of one want at the expense of another want. It arises as a result of scarce resources to satisfy numerous wants and desires, e.g. the opportunity cost of purchasing a textbook, to a student, is the shirt he should have bought which he sacrificed to get the textbook. Opportunity cost means real cost and it is different from money cost. The real cost of the text-book is the shirt forgone.</p><p><strong>(b)(i)Importance of opportunity cost to individuals: </strong>It helps individuals to make judicious use of their scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. For example, a farmer can use a piece of land for planting cocoa or coffee. If he grows cocoa because of the present economic value of cocoa, the opportunity cost of cocoa is the coffee forgone.</p><p><strong>(ii) Importance of opportunity cost to the Government:</strong> It helps the government in deciding which sector will receive more resources. It helps the government in making decision on how to spend its revenue in carrying out its numerous projects, e.g. the government may allocate more resources to defence or infrastructure.</p><p><strong>(iii) Importance of opportunity cost to the firms: </strong>It helps the firms or industry in making decision on which resources to use in production and the method of production to be used, i.e. capital intensive or labour intensive. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>Describe any five problems of distribution in Nigeria. <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>Problems of distribution in Nigeria are:</strong><br>\n(I) Inadequate infrastructural facilities: Facilities like electricity, telecommunication are not adequate.</p><p><strong>(ii) Inadequate storage facilities/warehouse:</strong> This especially affects perishable products which come seasonally. During harvests, there is excess supply of these products, but there is scarcity as soon as the excess is over.</p><p><strong>(iii) Hoarding and speculation in Nigeria: </strong>The traders can create artificial scarcity for some commodities especially during festive periods such as Christmas and Ramadan. Artificial scar-city can also occur as a result of change in government policies. This disrupts the distributive process and increases prices unnecessarily.</p><p><strong>(iv) Packaging problems: </strong>The packaging of goods is not standardized. This may result in damage or loss in transit.</p><p><strong>(v) Inadequate transport facilities:</strong> The poor transport system also affects commodity distribution and marketing in the country. The roads are so bad that commodities sustain great damage due to accidents.</p><p><strong>(vi) Long chain of distribution: </strong>There are too many middlemen. The numerous links along the chain of distribution make the price of commodities to increase considerably.</p><p><strong>(vii) Insecurity on Nigerian roads:</strong> Distribution is affected as a result of the activities of armed bandits on the road.</p><p><strong>(viii) Administrative bottle-necks in the collection and handling of goods:</strong> Excessive delay in the supply and delivery of commodities is a common feature in the Nigerian distribution system. Processing of necessary papers at supply point or depots causes considerable loss of time. <br>\n </p>",

It provides information about age, sex, occupation, residence etc.</p><p><strong>(bi) Implications of optimum population: </strong>Optimum population may be defined as the population which combines with the available resources and the given level of existing technology to secure a maximum return per head. An optimum population is the population that produces full employment and the highest standard of living in a country. Optimum population is a dynamic population that changes with the changing quantity and quality of a country's available resources.</p><p><strong>(bii)Implications of over population: Over population is the population that exceeds the available resources of a country. Its implications are:</strong><br>\n(i) It will lead to unemployment.<br>\n(ii) Over population causes a fall in the standard of living of the people of a country.<br>\n(iii) It causes shortage of social amenities like schools, roads, pipe borne water and electricity.<br>\n(iv) Overpopulation will reduce output per head.<br>\n(v) It leads to congestion in the cities.<br>\n(vi) Over population leads to high rate of illiteracy.<br>\n(vii) Over population leads to high import bills. <br>\n </p>",

Households need to hold money in order to cater for the interval between the receipt of incomes and their expenditures.</p><p><strong>(ii) Precautionary motives:</strong> This is when people demand for money in order to meet up with unforeseen circumstances or unexpected expenditures. These may include sickness, unexpected visitors etc. Due to uncertainties in life, people keep money against future emergencies that may require monetary expenditures.</p><p><strong>(iii) Speculative motives: </strong>This motive is specifically a business motive and refers to the desire to hold cash balances in order to embark on speculative dealings in the bond market. The demand to hold money for speculative purposes is interest elastic. <br>\n </p>",

These are short and long term capital movements. A country's balance of payments is favourable when money received is more than the amount she pays out and vice versa.</p><p><strong>(iii) Monetary movement account: </strong>This shows how the balance on both current and capital accounts is settled. It shows how the surplus or deficit on both accounts is settled. </p>",
