Some people like to remain their own boss, to enjoy the pride of ownership. They therefore remain because expanding may mean inviting partners<br>\nand so sharing ownership<br>\n(v) For security sake It may be risk to depend only on one large supplier, Therefore orders may be placed with small firms regularly just to keep them in business.<br>\n(vi) The size of the business unit tends to be small where the work involves the provision of direct services.<br>\n(vii) Fear of the risk: The nature of the product may be such that there are frequent changes in demand e.g. in the fashion trade, production will be on small scale so as to minimize loss if there is a fall in demand.<br>\n(viii) Government policy. Governments may institute anti-monopoly polices or policies to assist small firms.<br>\n(ix) Where the market size is small, production must be on a small scale.<br>\n(x) Small firms are easy to manage and control/ inadequate expertise in managing large scale enterprise<br>\n(xi) Small firms require small legal and administrative procedures to set up. </p>",

It attempts to explain the relationship between fertility and mortality on population growth. The theory explains how all developed countries in contemporary times have passed through three identical stages or population history.<br>\n<br>\n(b) Stages of the theory:  <br>\n<strong>Stage (I) (pre-transition phase/stage): </strong><br>\nThis stage is characterized by high fertility and high mortality rates In this stage the population is fairly stable, static or decreasing or increasing at a low rate.<br>\nIt is a feature of the pre-industrial society.<br>\n<strong>Stage (II) (Transition stage/phase)</strong>: In this stage both fertility and mortality are declining. Fertility decline less rapidly at first and then grows more rapidly than mortality leading to an increase tn population. It is a period of population explosion as a result of high birth rates and low death rates. <br>\nIt is a feature of an economy at the industrial take-off It is feature of developing economy.</p><p><strong>Stage (iii) (Post- transition phase/stage): </strong><br>\nBoth fertility and mortality are low and under control at this stage. The growth rate is controlled as population remains, more or less stable i.e it is a period of low birth rate. and low death rates, which leads to little or no population growth.

        "answer": "<p>(a) A share is the smallest unit into which the capital of a company is divided. It is a unit of ownership of a business concern.<br>\nIt is usually expressed in terms of money-capital. Shares can take different forms.<br>\nA shareholder receives dividend when the company makes and declares profit. He also has a voting right.<br>\nWhile a debenture is a loan capital or corporate bond. A debenture holder is a creditor to the company.<br>\nHe receives interest on his capital whether or not the company makes profit.<br>\n<br>\n(b) <strong>Problems encountered by firms in raising capital</strong><br>\n(i) Low level of loanable funds for investment The level of<br>\ncapital that firms can raise is therefore low.<br>\n(ii) Inability of firms to provide the required collateral securities to obtain loans from financial Institutions limits their ability to raise capital.<br>\n(iii) Underdeveloped money and capital markets also reduces the ability of firms to raise capital.<br>\n(iv) High cost of loans/hi9h interest rates. The interest charged by the financial institutions on loans is high<br>\nThis discourages investors from borrowing from banks<br>\n(v) Inadequate demand reduces the level of profits which could have been ploughed back.<br>\n(vi) The risk involved and the fluctuating of share prices discourages some people from subscribing to the shares of companies.<br>\nThis reduces the ability of firms to raise capital.<br>\n(vii) Lack of trust, poor business experience and practices make it extremely difficult for indigenous businessmen to obtain bank loans.<br>\n(viii) Government financial regulations which are sometimes very stringent, make it quite difficult for businessmen to obtain necessary funds and approval required to start their businesses.<br>\n(ix) High rate of default in repayments makes lenders reluctant in advancing loans to a good number of indigenous businessmen, who of course, could not start any business without such assistance given at appropriate time.<br>\n(x) High cost of production reduces the level of profits which could have been ploughed back</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) (i) Consumers' Co-operative are associations of consumers who pool their resources together, buy goods in bulk at wholesales prices from producers and<br>\nthen sell the goods at retail prices to members and non-members.<br>\nThe intention is to make the goods readily available to members at reasonable prices by eliminating the middlemen.<br>\nProfits are shared among members in the form of dividends based on how much a member buys<br>\n(ii) Producers' Co-operatives association are producers who are in the same line of production who come together to do joint business.<br>\nThey use their resources collectively to produce particular products, alternatively may produce separately, but make joint arrangements<br>\nfor selling the products. They share useful knowledge among themselves<br>\n(iii) Thrift and Credit Co-operative are associations of usually low income earners who contribute money, the total of which goes to members in turn. Sometimes, the money collected may be given as loan to a needy member at minimal interest, Thus member are encouraged to save and they also enjoy a greater bulk of money at a time. Members share profits/surplus in form of dividends.<br>\n<br>\n(b) Problems faced by Co-operative Societies<br>\n(i) Members have other interest and so elected officials may apply themselves to the work only on Part-time basis.<br>\n(ii) Members being low income earners are unable to subscribe much share capital and so this limits the development of the co-operative.<br>\n(iii) Problem of maintaining loyalty. Members as mentioned have other interests and may not give full-loyalty to the cooperative.<br>\n(iv) Competition from other outlets<br>\n(v) Officers are to be elected from among the members. It may happen that at any one time there may not be qualified people and so unqualified people will be elected to run the business.<br>\n(vi) There have been cases of embezzlement of funds by the elected officers.</p>",
