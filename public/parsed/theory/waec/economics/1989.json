Increase in prices of imports, as a result of devaluation will reduce the demand for import.</p><p>(ii) The country's export must have elastic demand in other countries.</p><p>(iii) Other nations should not devalue their own currencies</p><p>(iv) For devaluation to be effective, there must be no increase in wages and other incomes. <br>\n </p>",

For example, an import duty is due and paid as the imported goods arrive the country.</p><p>(iv) Certainty: The tax should be certain and clear to everybody concerned. The time of payment, the manner of payment and the amount to be paid should be clear and plain to the tax payer.</p><p>(i) Taxes are imposed on Nigerians to promote economic growth. This can be achieved by imposing lower tax on company profits that are ploughed back into the business.</p><p>(ii) Taxation is used to effect the redistribution of income in the society.</p><p>(iii) Taxes are used to provide social services such as education, poverty alleviation, social insurance etc.</p><p>(iv) Taxes are means of controlling the economy in order to achieve full employment.
