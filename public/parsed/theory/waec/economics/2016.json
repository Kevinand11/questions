They also provide marketing facilities for their produce.</p><p>(b) Government can assist peasant farming through:<br>\n(i) Establishment of rural and agricultural banks to provide credit facilities for the peasant farmers.<br>\n(ii) Provision of subsidies: Farming inputs and equipments should be sold to the farmers at subsidized rates.<br>\n(iii) Control of pests and diseases: Farmers should be assisted by the government to control diseases and fight pests. Chemicals and pesticides should be supplied at subsidized rates.<br>\n(iv) The provision of infrastructural facilities in the rural areas to stem rural-urban migration so as to retain labour for agricultural purpose.<br>\n(v) Land reforms which make larger land available to the farmers should be implemented.<br>\n(vi) Provision of storage facilities. e.g. silos, sold room etc so as to minimize post-harvest losses.<br>\n(vii) Employment of extension workers to provide training for the farmers.<br>\n(viii) Marketing facilities should be made available e.g. improved transportation, establishment of market stalls in rural areas.<br>\n(ix) Implementation of adequate pricing policy to stabilize farmers' incomes.<br>\n(x) Establishment of agro-based industries to make use of farm produce.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Price elasticity of supply: it is the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a commodity to a given change in its price <strong>OR</strong>  it is the percentage change in quantity supplied of a commodity to a percentage change in its price. </p><p><br>\n(b) Joint supply occurs when two or more commodities are produced and supplied from one source such that the supply of one commodity will lead to the supply of the other(s). Competitive supply on the other hand occurs when a commodity has alternative uses. An increase in the supply of one of its uses will reduce its supply for other uses.</p><p>(c) (i) Time: supply of commodities tends to be more inelastic in the short run and as time elapses, the more elastic it becomes e.g. agricultural produce.<br>\n(ii) Cost of production: Commodities with higher cost of production inputs tend to be more inelastic while commodities with lower cost of productive inputs are more elastic because it is cheaper to obtain more inputs to increase supply.<br>\n(iii) Nature of the product: Durable commodities tend to have more elastic supply while perishable commodities tend to have inelastic supply because they cannot be stored for long.<br>\n(iv) Market discrimination or segmentation: Commodities that can be sold at different prices in different markets tend to be more elastic while supply will be inelastic for commodities that can be sold in only one market.<br>\n(v) Availability of storage facilities: commodities that can be stored for a long time tend to have elastic supply while those that cannot be stored tend to have inelastic supply.<br>\n(vi) Number of producers: the larger the number of producers, the easier it is to increase output in response to price changes making supply elastic.<br>\n(vii) Mobility/availability of factors of production: if factors of production are more mobile the price elasticity of supply tends to be more elastic.</p>",

When there is excess liquidity in the economy, the central bank will sell her treasury bills and vice versa.<br>\n(ii) Liquidity ratio/cash ratio: banks are mandated by the law to keep a percentage of their total deposits in the form of liquid assets. This percentage can be increased if the central bank wants to reduce money supply and vice versa. <br>\n(iii) Bank rate: This is the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks and also discount bills of exchange. To increase money supply the central bank will reduce the bank rate and vice versa.<br>\n(iv) Special deposit: the central bank can mandate banks to make special deposits with it so as to mop up excess liquidity when the need arises.<br>\n(v) Special directives: the central bank can order or instruct other banks to increase their lending to a particular sector so as to stimulate the sector for the overall growth of the economy.<br>\n(vi) Moral suasion: unlike other instruments, this is more of an appeal to other banks to restrict or expand their loans to a particular sector(s) of the economy.<br>\n(vii) Funding: this refers to the process where short-term debts of government are converted to long-term debts to reduce excess liquidity. </p>",
