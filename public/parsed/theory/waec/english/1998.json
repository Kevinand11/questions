The disturbance, no doubt is the culmination of students' expression of dislike of the excesses of the teachers. <br>\n      The demonstration started from the SS3 block. The students were totally frustrated by the excesses of the teachers and your failure to take actions at the proper time. The students often complained to me and it will be necessary for me to enumerate the factors that led to the disturbance. First, some members of staff took it upon themselves to terrorize the students. For instance, the case of Mrs. Nwandu, the house mistress of the Red House going about every i morning, about 5:30am, to beat the students claiming that they are supposed to wake up early is still fresh in our memory. <br>\n      Secondly, the students were unable to get water to bath in the morning last week. As a result of this, they got to the dining hall late. The students were flogged severely for this. The matrons who are expected to be motherly too were very tyrannical. They screamed and yelled at us at every simple mistake made. We are children and, are expected to be taught through other more appropriate methods than flogging and yelling. <br>\n      There is no doubt that I was involved in the planning and execution of the disturbance. As the President of the Press Club, students often come to me to complain about the oppressive nature of the teaching and non-teaching staff of the school. Various measures have been taken by the club to plead with the school authorities on behalf of the students, all to no avail. In a bid to join the recent disturbance, four officials of the club and I resigned from the club. We moved into action to plan the protest. Indeed, I was the master planner. Some books in the library were of great help. These books include: \"Standing on the rights of a school child\" by Edward Blyton and \"Don't oppress them\" by David Anderson. These two books enlightened me about the various rights of a school child which the school authority had been infringing upon. <br>\n      I, therefore, spoke to other students on how and when we should execute our plans which resulted in the violent i demonstration and my eventual suspension from the school. I sincerely feel remorse for my involvement in the demonstration. I did not know that the simple protest march around the school which I planned to drive home our grievances could lead to a violent demonstration during which many school properties were destroyed. <br>\n      I am very sorry sir, for my involvement in the demonstration. I did not envisage that it could lead to such mass destruction of the school property. I have learnt my lessons. <br>\n      I would be grateful if you could accept my apology and recall me from suspension. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yours faithfully. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    (Signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Gbolahan Adeoye.</p>",

        "question": "<p> Write an article for publication in a national newspaper on why you think a woman should be your country's next president.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                   NIGERIA'S NEXT PRESIDENT SHOULD BE A WOMAN. <br>\n      Nigeria is currently undergoing another transition programme from military to civilian rule. Next year, it is expected that a new civilian president will emerge to direct the affairs of the country. The presidential candidates for each of the parties have been nominated but there is one thing that I am sure most of us have not noticed. All the candidates are men! <br>\n      Sometimes. I sit down and wonder why we cannot have at least a woman among the presidential candidates. Since we got independence in 1960 no woman has been given the chance to contest the presidential election and I think that our great nation is making a mistake. First and foremost, if Nigeria has a woman as her president, there are so many advantages and benefits that we can enjoy. One of such benefits is that a woman president can be more honest than men. When we have an honest president, then we can begin to think of economic growth. <br>\n      Furthermore, we all know the popular saying which goes thus: \"What a man can do, a woman can do better\". Indeed, this saying is true because women have proved to be better leaders than men. For instance, look at the famous Magaret Thatcher. She is a woman of virtue. discipline and honour. She has proved that women can in fact excel in a man's world. <br>\n      In addition to this, if Nigeria's next president is. a woman, she would be upright, disciplined and very firm. She would realise that she is in a man's world and that at s.he is facing many challenges in which she cannot afford to fail because she wants to prove a point. Therefore, this will make h. er work very hard and to be firm in decision-taking. She will not bend for anybody. If we have a president who is. very firm, bribery and corruption will be curbed. <br>\n      Similarly, there will be less chances of waging war. The country under the rule of a woman will be at peace with her neighbours. Instead of going to war, a woman will easily negotiate for peace and she will also make sure that she is always at peace with the citizens of the country. <br>\n      I must also state that women are usually compassionate by nature, although they can be firm. If Nigeria has a female president, she would feel strongly for the little children, the poor, the widow and the less privileged who beg by the roadsides. Also, those people who do not have clothing and shelter will be taken care of. <br>\n      Finally, I must say that if Nigerians elect. a female president,. it will be a great turning point in the history of the Country. it will ill also be an honour to have will s first. woman president after the long military rule. If Nigerians can give Women a chance, I am sure that they will not regret it.</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Kunle Adetimilehin. <br>\n                                                                                                                                     O.I.G.S.

I hope that you are doing very fine. Health-wise we are alright, but we are facing a lot of hardships here in Nigeria. This is what spurred me to write this letter to you. As you are aware, there are severe economic difficulties in Nigeria and our family is not spared. <br>\n      We are passing through a hard time now. In the last eight months, things have gone bad for daddy and mummy. Daddy was retrenched August last year and since then, he has not been able to get another job. Four months after hrs. retrenchment, he sold the land that he bought few years back with the aim of setting up a soap business. He actually started the soap-making business but the harsh economic situation snuffed life out of the business. That was how the big sum of money daddy invested in the business went down the drain. <br>\n      Daddy's misfortune has really affected mummy's business badly. Can you believe that mummy's shop which was usually filled to the brim with wares is now a shadow of its former self? All the capital that mummy used to re-cycle into the business has been used to feed the family since daddy can't provide money for feeding again. <br>\n      Bimbo and Tunde have been withdrawn from the private primary school they were attending before to the public school near our house. I was offered an admission to read Accountancy at the Ogun State Polytechnic last year and I couldn't register because there was no money. The experiences are terrifying and traumatic. There is always bickering and quarreling in the family nowadays; a bad and ugly thing that was never given a chance in the family in the past. Daddy feels touchy and, in most cases, visits his frustration and anger on mummy and us. <br>\n      Brother Kunle, the family needs your assistance financially now more than ever before. I know that you'll not be happy to see the family in shambles and to save daddy from developing hypertension, you should send some money to assist him. Mummy too needs your assistance to revamp her business. Her shop will soon be closed totally unless you send some financial assistance to her. <br>\n      We shall be expecting your assistance very soon. Extend my greetings to your wife and the children.<br>\n                                                                                                                                     Yours sincerely. <br>\n                                                                                                                                      Kola. </p>",

        "question": "<p> You are the chief speaker in a school debate the topic of which is \"Public secondary schools are better than the private ones\". Write your speech for or against the topic.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>.                                      PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS ARE BETTER THAN PUBLIC ONES. <br>\n      Good morning, chairman, panel of Judges, accurate time keeper, co-debaters, ladies and gentlemen. I am here to oppose the motion which states that \"public secondary schools are better than the private ones\" Public secondary schools are run and managed by state or federal government while private schools are established and managed by private individuals. Private schools are individual investment where students pay heavily for their education. In public secondary schools, students pay only a token amount of money as educational and development levies. Private secondary schools are better than public ones. <br>\n      Private schools have necessary facilities and infrastructure. Private schools can afford to provide all these facilities for students because they realise a lot of money from school fees and other levies. Unlike public schools where there is paucity of these necessary facilities, private schools have good laboratories, libraries and good classrooms which always make the school environment conducive for learning. <br>\n      Furthermore, private secondary schools have more qualified teachers to teach different subjects so that they could be patronized. Among these private secondary schools. there is intense competition which makes it expedient for each of them to recruit the best teachers around. Apart from this. some subjects have two teachers thereby giving room for efficiency and specialisation. This is not the case with public secondary schools where government just recruits teachers who are less qualified so that it could pay less. <br>\n      Teachers in private secondary schools are hardworking. In fact, there is no room for laziness. Teachers work very hard since they are highly paid. Besides, they are given incentives which motivate them to work hard Cases of absenteeism, lateness to work and lateness or refusal to attend classes which are very rampant among teachers in public schools cannot be found among private secondary school teachers. <br>\n      There is no doubt that private secondary schools always struggle to justify the amount of money they collect as school fees. They parade the best students in the country. The best condition and atmosphere for learning are provided for students in private secondary schools. Therefore. ladies and gentlemen. I am of the candid view that they are far better than public secondary schools. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                             CUT YOUR COAT ACCORDING TO YOUR CLOTH. <br>\n      Ngozi Okongwu was the only child born to her poor parents. Mr. and Mrs. Okongwu. The family was so poor that it hardly provided food and clothing for Ngozi. The family was wallowing s wallowin in abject poverty and therefore could not afford to h send Ngozi to school early in her life. The family was later helped by Mr. Okongwu's childhood friend who volunteered to sponsor Ngozi to school. <br>\n      Ngozi was registered in a nursery school very near her parents' house. Her father's friend, Mr. Collins sponsored her education right from nursery school through secondary school. Unfortunately, while in secondary school, Ngozi joined a group of friends who came from rich families. She was keeping the company of these spoilt children from rich homes while forgetting her poor background. In a short time, Ngozi realised that her parents could not afford to get her the kind short  of things her friends had. In her quest to live up to the standard of her rich friends, she decided to steal. Initially, she began to steal money from her classmates' bags. Before too long, she began to steal from her teachers handbags and later she became a 'professional' thief who can pilfer out of daylight. <br>\n      After a while, Ngozi began wearing clothes made b e y the latest designers and, in most cases, this entered her head and she started disrespecting her teachers and elders. All this while, her parents were too busy trying to earn a living by farming. However, they started noticing all the make-up their daughter was applying and how snobbish and disrespectful she had become. They knew that something was wrong. Her mother searched her room and found all sorts of expensive clothes. Ngozi's parents decided to question her to find out where she had got all the things found in her room. She got angry with her mother and left the house. She wondered why she should be questioned that way and out of annoyance, she decided to leave her parents' home for her friends'. <br>\n      One fateful day, Ngozi was in need of a beautiful and expensive dress to wear to a party which she had agreed to attend with her boyfriend...She had no money, and so, she decided to steal one expensive and colourful dress she had seen at a shop on Adeniyi Jones Street in Lagos. She got ready on this day and off she went. On getting into the shop, she looked around for the dress. She stealthily walked to where the dress was hung, picked it up and put it in her bag hurriedly. After doing this, she thought nobody had seen her and she made for the exit door. <br>\n      At the door, a security man was always there to check people leaving the shop. He had seen Ngozi picking up the dress but he was not sure whether she had paid for it. As Ngozi was about to go out of the shop, the security man accosted her and demanded to search her bag. Ngozi was found out and after she was beaten mercilessly and the stolen dress collected from her, she was taken to a juvenile home where teenage offenders are kept. <br>\n      Ngozi's friends were nowhere to be seen. Her parents had to go to the juvenile home to see her when the news of her arrest and detention reached them. As Ngozi saw her parents, poorly clad in their wretchedness, she burst into tears. Her mother said to her \"Ngozi, if only you had cut your coat according to your cloth,  you wouldn't be here now.\"</p>",

        "question": "<p>You have just taken part in a local festival in your village. Write an article for publication in a cultural magazine describing the festival, its origin and importance to your people and the role you played.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                                      A LOCAL FESTIVAL IN MY VILLAGE <br>\n      The arrival of civilization and western culture has made us to forget our cultural past Our heritage has been lost and traded off for the western ways. Those cultural heritages which had delighted our fore-fathers are looked down upon by youths who regard these heritages as old-fashioned and anachronistic. <br>\n      I must confess that I did share this opinion with my peers but l have to give it another thought when I was privileged to accompany my parents to our village to witness a local festival. <br>\n      The festival is usually celebrated every first Saturday of September in my village, Obong. Every year, the indigenes travel from far and near to convene at Obudu Market Square, the venue of the annual new yam festival. <br>\n      The origin of this festival goes as far back as when the first group of settlers fled to the plateau for safety and decided to dwell there. I can recollect vividly what my grandfather told me about the first festival when the settlers had their first new yam harvested. Tradition has it that the very first celebration was held at the summit of the Obudu plateau. The joy and happiness shared among the people was enough to pull the heavens according to my grandmother. Ever since, the celebration has taken the same pattern.<br>\n      Last year the new yam festival which I witnessed began on Thursday. The day preceding that Thursday, all men in the village woke up very early in the morning and left for their farms. They returned in :e evening with their children carrying large tubers of yam on their heads. I joined the village children to carry the tubers which we dropped at the market square.<br>\n      In the evening, the men gathered after taking their bath to discuss over a gourd of freshly-tapped palmwine. Their discussion took them into the far night before they went to sleep in their various homes. <br>\n      Very early the next day. the women started peeling the yams for cooking They brought all ingredients together for the cooking while the young men prepared themselves to carry masquerades. The girls, like myself. were not allowed to cook but we helped the women in cooking the food. <br>\n      Saturday finally arrived and the festival was scheduled to begin at noon. As early as 7:00 am on that day, the women were up again to add finishing touches to their cooking and finally they pounded the yams. The real festival began with the arrival of the 'Usu.. the chief who was followed by the masquerades. The young girls like myself dressed beautifully with the 'jigida' beads around our waists. We danced to entertain the Usu' and his chiefs who occasionally waved their locally made fans. Then the food was served and there was more than enough to go round. Everybody ate to his or her satisfaction. Finally. after all the dancing. singing and eating the festival came to an end in the early hours of Sunday morning. <br>\n      I could say that this festival is of great importance to the Obudu people because it is the only time of the year when all indigenes of the village far and near. come together to felicitate. Moreover, the festival gave me a sense of pride that I have a heritage which l can be proud of.</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Iniobong Etim, <br>\n                                                                                                                                     O.I.G.S .

It was always a day when the results of the promotion examinations were announced to the students after weeks of suspense. The afternoon commenced with all the students taking their seats in the large hall, and the members of staff, led by the principal, filing in. There were also three guests, each of them an important <ins>figure  </ins>in the town. The principal and the dignitaries made speeches admonishing the students to work hard in order to attain their goal.

Right there in the examination hall, <ins>while his pen is dancing furiously on the paper</ins>, the candidate may remember a beautiful tune as if his mind is saying: \"Forget this task, enjoy some music.\" <br>\n      Happily, these do not usually disrupt the exercise at hand: the task goes on while the candidate may smile to himself at the strange recall of the joke or music. <br>\n      The brain can play a different type of trick. A fact long stored up and remembered a short while before the examination can suddenly evaporate. All attempts to recall it may prove unsuccessful. Usually, till the paper ends, the fact remains <ins>elusive</ins>  only to resurface much later when not needed. <br>\n      The candidate does not fare better in an oral examination. His problems are heightened by the fact that his fate depends entirely on the examiner's assessment of him rather than what he writes down himself. The facial appearance of the examiner is also a strong factor since a <ins>stern</ins>, unsmiling examiner can be intimidating. <br>\n      Yet, an examination candidate need not be frightened. He needs all the <ins>calmness</ins>  he can muster. He should sleep soundly before the exercise trusting that all the preparations he made earlier will not fail him at the hour of need. The fact is that one forgets more when one is tired, especially when one panics unnecessarily. <br>\n(a) In what two ways is an examination candidate similar to a boxer? <br>\n(b) Identify two direct results of pressure on the candidate. <br>\n(c) Give two examples of the funny tricks the brain can play on the candidate. <br>\n(d) Give two reasons why a candidate may have a greater problem at an oral examination than at a written paper. <br>\n(e) \". . while his pen is dancing furiously on the paper' (i) What figure of speech is this?

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.</p><p><br>\n      We have often heard students making wild assertions that the public examining bodies are their worst enemies. Some, in fact, see the officials of these public examining bodies as wicked souls scheming day and night to devise ways of failing them. How correct are these assertions? The facts will speak for themselves. <br>\n      The task of setting an examination paper begins long before the examination day. Indeed. months or years before then, seasoned experts in the-various subjects are given the teaching and examination syllabuses and requested to set questions. These are compiled for subsequent scrutiny. Then a second set of experts is invited to examine the questions critically, make necessary modifications and come up with questions that conform with acceptable standards. The result of this exercise is a set of polished and unambiguous questions that are very fair to those being examined. These questions are then securely stored. <br>\n      The next stage is the registration of candidates This stage involves not just the examining body, but also the candidates, their parents. their teachers. principals and some other members of the public. This is so because apart from the candidate having to fill in the forms. his principal has to endorse them while the parents have to provide the registration fee. Any mistake or inaction on the part of any of these may ruin the candidates chances. If, for instance, the candidate makes a mistake in his choice of subjects or in completing his forms or if the principal does not forward the registration fee at the right time. his chances in the examination may be jeopardized. <br>\n      Next is the conduct of the examination itself. Again. more officials from outside the examining body than from within it are involved. Think of the supervisors. the invigilators, and even the security officials. They are definitely more in number than the staff of the examining body and any one of them could take an action that might result in the failure of candidates. Take the invigilator for instance If he is negligent candidates could swap answer scripts under his very nose; and when this is detected by the markers, as it often is. the results of the candidates may be cancelled. <br>\n      Probably, the most hated person to the candidates is the marker whom they, in their ignorance, regard as a wicked drunkard who delights in failing candidates. What candidates do not realize is that an examiner is trained to score points strictly according to a carefully prepared marking scheme from which he must not deviate it is his constitution. Besides, his work is consistently checked by his team leader and the chief examiner. Should he be discovered to have marked inaccurately, he could be removed. So, contrary to candidates' opinion. the examiner is a seasoned teacher, a careful scorer, a person always on his guard. <br>\n      The final stage comes with the collation of results. This stage is mainly computerized, and computers do not make mistakes. A candidate's results may not be processed if he is involved in a malpractice, has used a wrong examination number or no number at all, or if he fails to write all the papers that make up a subject. So. when a result is withheld, the fault is mostly that of the candidate.<br>\n      How then should we view the activities of the public examining bodies? Definitely, we should view them with understanding, sympathy and appreciation. <br>\n(a) In one sentence, summarize the writer's purpose in this passage. <br>\n(b) In two sentences, one for each, state how the actions of the candidate and the invigilator can jeopardize the candidate's chances of success. <br>\n(c) In three sentences, one for each summarize the steps taken by examining bodies to ensure that candidates are given a fair chance of success. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The writer's purpose is to show that students' allegations against public examining bodies are not true. <br>\n(b)(i) The candidate jeopardizes his chances of success if he makes a mistake in filling his examination form. <br>\n(ii) Negligence by the invigilator can jeopardize candidate's chances of success. <br>\n(c) The steps taken by examining bodies to ensure that candidates are given a fair chance of success are: <br>\n(i) They ensure that examination questions are fair to the candidates <br>\n(ii) They ensure that candidates' answer scripts are accurately marked <br>\n(iii) The collation of examination results is done by computers and this is error-free. </p>",
