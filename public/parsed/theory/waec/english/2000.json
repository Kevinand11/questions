In fact, it has been very hectic at home since our mummy came back from her journey to London. Things are not really what they used to be. It is going from bad to worse and I think that I should bring the situation to your notice before it goes beyond redemption. <br>\n      As you are aware mummy travelled to London in January and she came back last month to meet the home in a mess.  of us were at home when the ugly incident that has soured the relationship between daddy and mummy happened. We, the children. were away in our boarding school and only came back to be told that our daddy was having a secret love affair with Julie, our housemaid. A neighbour of ours first let the cat out of the bag and soon after, it became a rumour spreading widely in our neighbourhood It was a great shock to us and we kept quiet waiting for mummy to come back. <br>\n      Things came to a head when mummy came back three weeks after. On her arrival. she tried to embrace daddy but t she was restrained by Wale. my junior brother who felt very bad about the incident. I then decided to call mummy aside lc and tell her all that had happened. She burst into tears and walked out of the sitting room. Meanwhile, to our great )i amazement, our maid came out of the room with her protruded belly carrying a four month pregnancy. My mother fell a down at that point and fainted. Our neighbours ran in and helped her to the hospital. She spent two weeks in the hospital before she was discharged.<br>\n      We were all in a state of dilemma and we marvelled at the unravelled mystery. What makes the matter worse is that daddy insists that he is going to marry Julie as his second wife and this does not go down well with us. Uncle, since then the blood pressure of mummy has risen and she has had to visit the hospital several times thereafter. Mummy has, therefore, decided to pack out of a the house next month. <br>\n      This is the reason why I decided to write this letter to you for your intervention in this matter. As you are mummy's brother, I want you to help talk to her. I learnt that you studied Guidance and Counselling in the university and I know that you would be able to bring the family together again. Moreover, you did such reconciliation two years ago between Mr. and Mrs. Bankole and it was very successful. I would be grateful if you can perform the same feat now. I know that mummy, and even daddy, will listen to you. I strongly believe that if you intervene in this matter quickly, daddy and mummy would be reconciled and they would be at peace with each other once again. <br>\n      How are aunty Funmi and your children? Extend my greetings to every member of your family. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Olakunle. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                          WHY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A MEDICAL DOCTOR <br>\n      When I finish from this school. I should like to study medicine in the university. I have nursed this ambition right from childhood. I can remember when I was ill and was taken to a hospital when I was twelve years old. I was fascinated by the activities and hospitality of the doctor who took care of me on my sick bed. He so much endeared himself to me that, there and then, I decided to study medicine when I grow up. <br>\n      Medicine, as a profession. commands great respect anywhere in the world. Medical doctors are respected for being hospitable and kind. They are kind to their patients whom they tend like seedlings which must not be allowed to die. A medical doctor cannot afford to be unkind or cruel to his patient as to allow his patient to suffer. He must be genial, good-natured, hospitable and must have a good disposition towards his patient. <br>\n      Furthermore, medicine is a business of saving lives. This makes the profession to be regarded as the most noble profession in the world. If there were no doctors, many lives would be lost on daily basis. Doctors are professionals with adequate knowledge of all parts of human body and one cannot but be proud of belonging to such a profession. Doctors serve and contribute to humanity more than any other professional. <br>\n      In addition to this, the medical profession is one of the most lucrative professions in the world. It gives practitioners the opportunity to work for the government in the government hospital and at the same time engage in private practic.e Therefore, it gives the practitioners the privilege to establish their own hospitals and clinics thereby making it possible for them to make a lot of money. <br>\n      Moreover the medical profession gives one the opportunity to meet a lot of people. It makes one to be influential and popular because as a medical doctor, many people would want to be associated with you A patient whom you have i treated in the hospital would always remember how you help him and his family would for ever be grateful to you. All these make a medical practitioner popular and influential in the society. Many people would want to respect him and his opinion on any matter in the society. <br>\n      Lastly, a medical practitioner with a stethoscope hanging on his neck is always a good sight to behold. This has also endeared me greatly to the profession and I have a dream of hanging the identifying instrument of the profession on my neck in the nearest future. Medical doctors are always very neat and they look resplendent in their white overall coat. This makes them respectable and the profession dignified.<br>\n      Of course, I know what it takes to become a medical doctor and I am ready to do all it takes to belong to the medical profession. <br>\n                                                                                                                                      Adenlolu Olajide <br>\n                                                                                                                                      SS 2B </p>",

Cur environment is highly polluted to the extent that breathing has become difficult. The air we breathe in and out is heavily polluted and the community stands the risk of an epidemic outbreak. <br>\n      Refuse is dumped indiscriminately by the roadside and human feaces and toxic waste are emptied into the nearby stream. As a result of this, the stream which was flowing before is now stagnant, thus becomimg a breeding place for mosquitoes. What further complicates the whole situation is that some illiterate women do go to this stream to fetch water they use for cooking and other domestic chores. Some even drink the water from this stream. This has constituted a health hazard in the area as an epidemic can break out from this unhealthy condition and before we know it, many lives will be lost. <br>\n      The textile and the iron-smelting companies in our area have further worsened the situation as their furnace emit dark smokes into the air everyday. On every working day, our environment is highly polluted with smoke which makes breathing difficult for us. We only have respite at week-ends when these companies are not working. The toxic water coming out of the textile factory is another source of environmental pollution. Though the toxic water flows into the nearby canal, it leaves behind a greenish stain on the side of the gutter and I know it must be emitting some poisonous gases into the air. <br>\n      We are prone to a lot of health hazards, to say the least, and we want the government to come to our aid. This is very necessary in order to avert an outbreak of epidemic in the area. <br>\n      Recently, there were cases of some residents of the area who were taken to the hospital and they were diagnosed to have kidney problems. This is not unconnected with the impure air they breathed in. We would appreciate it if you could use your good offices to put in place a new and modern means of disposing toxic waste in our area. The waste disposal board has to consider our area as a high risk area and treat it as such with utmost urgency. <br>\n      I would be grateful if you could pay a visit to our community in order to be able to assess the situation and take urgent action to improve this unwholesome situation. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yours faithfully,<br>\n                                                                                                                                    (Signature)<br>\n                                                                                                                                    Olukunle Ebun <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                                                      I REMAIN GRATEFUL TO GOD <br>\n      In life, one may be confronted with an adverse situation that makes one depressed and disillusioned with life. Such a situation or case may be a blessing in disguise after all. What happened to me a few years ago has taught me a lesson that I should not be down-cast as a result of any adverse situation again. <br>\n      It happened that I was deeply in love with a young man called John. I loved him so much that I could lay down my life for him. I trusted him so much that decided to marry him though it was against my parents' wish. We courted for seven years and I always thought that I was made for John and he was made for me. The young man was handsome, intelligent and above all, loving and caring. <br>\n      I was in my final year in the University of Lagos and I was looking forward to becoming a wife and a mother when John came to tell me that he was on transfer to Port-Harcourt. We had a wonderful time together during the Christmas festivities preceding the year that he was to leave for Port-Harcourt. When he had settled down in Port-Harcourt, I visited him regularly for a year and the plan for our wedding after my national service was concluded. During my national service period, we used to communicate through letters for some time during which I noticed that something was wrong. Later, he stopped writing to me and after my national service, I decided to visit him in Port-Harcourt. <br>\n      When I got to where John was residing in Port-Harcourt, I was told that he had packed out of the house. However, I was directed to where he was living and I had a foreboding that something was going to happen. There John introduced me to a girl who was staying with him and said that the girl was pregnant for him. I wept bitterly and wondered how John could be so callous as to do that to me. I left his house with shame. I was highly disappointed but, determined to continue with life. <br>\n      Six months later, I met Bade, another handsome young man who later became my husband. He saved me from the emotional trauma which I went through as a result of John's unfaithfulness. About a year after my marriage, I heard that John had an accident when he was trying to escape through the border. It was then that I knew that he was on a drug smuggling mission to England when the accident occurred. <br>\n      John's wife died on the spot and he suffered terrible injuries that led to the amputation of his two legs. The police were waiting for him to recuperate in the hospital so that his trial could begin. I was grateful to God that He worked out John's exit from my life before the incident happened. <br>\n      Of course, what John did to me was painful. It took me some time before I got over it but I am grateful to God that I am alive and happily married with no stains on my record. His betrayal might have been difficult for me to bear. but it was indeed a blessing in disguise </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>A SPEECH AGAINST THE PROPOSITION THAT \"IT IS BETTER TO ATTEND A SCHOOL NEAR YOUR HOME THAN ONE OUTSIDE YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD.\"</strong></p><p> <br>\n      Good day, Mr. Chairman panel of Judges co-debators ladies and gentlemen and my most attentive audience. My name is Temilola Adekanbi a student of Okeira Grammar School. Okeira. I am here to oppose the motion which states: \"It is better to attend a school near your home than one outside your neighbourhood\".<br>\n      I believe strongly that it is better to attend a school outside ones neighbourhood. First, attending a neighbourhood school will limit the outlook and the perception of a person as a student. A student needs to go outside his neighbour-hood so that he could be widely accepted and recognised. It makes a student to be more cosmopolitan in outlook, comportment and behaviour. There is a tendency for a student who attends a neighbourhood school to be parochial in outlook and thinking. As a student, one must not be restricted or limited to ones environment alone because there is a lot to learn outside one's immediate neighbourhood.<br>\n      I am sure that my opponent would want to argue that a student who attends a school outside his neighbourhood would be tired and fagged out before getting to school everday However, attending a school outside one's neighbourhood makes one to be more time-conscious and more organised than a student who attends a school in the neighbourhood. A student who knows that he has to go to school outside his neighbourhood would organize his schedule effectively in order to be in his class at the appropriate time. Of course, chairman. ladies and gentlemen, you would all agree with me that such a student would be more effective, diligent and able to manage his or her time more effectively than the other who settles for a school nearer home. Such a student would not allow people to waste his time and he would face his studies with all seriousness because he is aware of the efforts he puts in before he gets to school. <br>\n      Furthermore, a student who attends a school outside his neighbourhood is unlikely to engage himself in trivial and irrelevant matters. He has his time-table which he keeps. He would not be bothered by irrelevant and trivial issues which would have bothered him should he attend a school near his home. He could not be on useless errands as his counterparts who are attending schools in the neighbourhood. He is immune against humdrum and mundane matters of the home and all his energy are channeled towards profitable ventures.<br>\n      Mr. Chairman sir. ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank you for giving me the time to make my points clear. Panel of Judges and my audience, I hope that I have been able to convince you that it is better to attend a school outside ones neighbourhood than to attend a school in one s neighbourhood. Thank you. <br>\n </p>",

For months. the doctors had combated the ailment with drugs of various kinds many of which sent me on long excursions into slumberland, Yet the ailment had seemed to defy all medical entreaties. Then a few days later, two senior surgeons called on me to discuss their decision They made it clear that only a surgical operation held any hope, otherwise the downward trend was sure to continue until the inevitable Quiet end. So. they sought my consent which I promptly gave, stating that at my age I was old enough to accept any eventuality.</p><p>      For days, I was gradually prepared for the great event. I took various drugs to build me up physically, and I was encouraged to eat well. Besides, a clergyman came regularly to talk to and pray for me He assured me that I would sail through the operation safely as God, the greatest of surgeons, would join the medical team Gradually I steeled myself to face the exercise.</p><p>      Then the day came. My wife came very early into the ward, looking as if she bore the burdens of all the world. I told her to be a good girl and cheer up. But all my jokes fell flat. So. when a senior nursing sister came and told my wife to go and buy one of the drugs needed, I was somehow relieved. Moments later, my eldest son came, and I told him to brace up for any eventuality. I said I was proud of his achievements as a young engineer, and of his immediate younger brother as a pharmacist. So, if the end should come, they should both rise to the occasion and steer their other brother and sister to good careers.

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.</p><p>      Are you scared of speaking before a large audience or even making a few suggestions in public? This need not be. You can make effective speeches in public. Here are a few pointers. Perhaps the most important step is to be sure of what you are going to say. This sounds obvious enough, but it is amazing how many people get up to speak when, in fact, they have very little to say. After one inconsequential point, they discover they have run out of steam. So to ensure you can speak well, the more conversant you are with them the more confident you will be.</p><p>      How do you present your speech? Certainly before you begin, you will be a little uneasy. Even the most experienced speaker feels the same way before beginning his speech. This is not bad; in fact, it is a good tonic for a successful speech. To overcome this, do not rush headlong into the task. Rather, it pays to breathe in and out, heavily, deeply calmly. Then begin the speech, slowly, calmly. carefully, with a clear, confident voice. This is when you are. going through the introduction. \"The Chairman, Honourable Guests of Honour. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen... By the time you finish this and go through the usual ritual of stating that it gives you \"great pleasure to stand before this august gathering to discuss a few points....,\" you would have reached a point of emotional equilibrium. You should now be sufficiently calm to go on with the speech.</p><p>      Somewhere at the beginning, and at strategic points in your speech. you should introduce flavour into what you are saying. You would not want to serve tea without sugar after all. So, you should inject some humorous remarks once in a while. But this calls for skill.
