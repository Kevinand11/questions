        "question": "<p>Write a story in your school magazine beginning or ending with the sentence; I wish I had never met the man.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                   HOW MY MEETING WITH TONY BECAME A CURSE</p><p>      I met Tony Frederick, the man whose relationship with me blighted my educational career and ruined my life completely and fortuitously at a party organised to honour my friend's sister. It happened that I went to visit Kern, my friend, who was living with her sister in lkoyi and my visit coincided with the day the party was organised. Initially, I didn't want to wait for the party but Kemi persuaded me to. Despite the fact that I didn't tell my parents that I would not be coming back home for the night, Kemi was able to persuade me to attend the party.</p><p>      Tony must have noticed me when Kemi and I were assisting the celebrant in serving food and drinks to her guests. He later came to excuse me to have a dance with him. Without giving it much thought, I quickly jumped at the chance by obliging to dance with Tony. Tony Frederick was a young man of twenty-four years. He was fairly tall and he had a fascinating and captivating look, and so when he asked me for a dance I could not but oblige him.</p><p>      After dancing with him for some time, he introduced himself to me: \"I am Tony Frederick. What is your name?\" He asked in whisper as his body got in contact with mine. I told him my name and before I knew what was happening, a rapport had started between us.</p><p>      Tony didn't say anything to me again until about 2.00am when he came into Kemi's personal room where I had retired to for a rest. It was in Kemi's room that Tony's interest in me was made known as he made love overtures to me. He introduced himself as a businessman who frequently travelled overseas. I told him that I was a school girl who was too young to get involved with a man of his age. Tony was not deterred by my excuses, and from his insistence grew a love relationship He gave me his address and promised to call on me in the school because I had warned him against coming to our house. since my parents would not approve of our relationship.</p><p>      I had forgotten everything about Tony until he visited me in the school in a white Mercedes Benz car. This visit opened the floodgate of chains of visits to my school and the commencement of the various love escapades and outings we had together. Tony pampered me with innumerable expensive gifts like clothes, and the more I accepted these gifts, the more I sank into the dungeon, where I later realised it might be difficult for me to get out.</p><p>      When my parents noticed that 1 came back home late from school whenever Tony visited they warned me after suspecting that something was happening. I hid many things from my parents and most of the gift items and clothes Tony bought for me were kept with my friends. Whenever he visited the school, we would go to have our fun in hotels. At times, I would sneak out of school to go out with Tony when lessons were going on. After some time. I lost my educational focus as I had the intention of furthering my education in the future. I became engrossed in my relationship with Tony and got lost in the maze of love affairs with him.</p><p>      Getting pregnant for Tony, I became confused because he didn't call on me frequently as he had been doing earlier on. However he called one day and I told him about the pregnancy and he decided to take me to his house. It was in his house that I got to know that Tony was a criminal, an armed robber. whose gang the police had been hunting for a long time. While I started getting to know Tony's true identity. a group of armed policemen swooped on the house and I was arrested with Tony and his gang.</p><p>      We were arraigned before a tribunal trying armed robbers and unfortunately I was jailed for nineteen years while Tony and his gang were executed. I gave birth to a male child while serving the jail term. After finishing my sentence, I could no longer go back to school. This tragedy ended my education career. I have disappointed my parents, who have undergone many traumatic and harrowing experiences and I have to live the rest of my life as a shameless and wayward lady, whose life has been ruined. I wish I had never met the man, Tony.</p>",

Suddenly, we heard a great noise which started from one of the nearby stalls. Everybody was alarmed and I could not continue the haggling of price I was engaged in with the meat seller. Out of curiosity, I suspended what I was doing and tried to see what was happening. The noise became louder as the crowd pursuing the suspected thief came closer to me.</p><p>      While I was trying to see what was really happening, a young man who was an albino ran across the meat stalls where I was and I noticed that a large crowd was running after him shouting; ole! ole!! As he was running. he was pleading his innocence but the crowd, defiant and determined as they were, gave him a hot chase.</p><p>      As the noise was spreading to the other parts of the market, a man, who must have sighted the albino and the crowd pursuing him, ran towards the thief and brought him down with a great stall.</p><p>      The suspected thief fell down and the crowd of angry traders converged on him venting their anger in vicious attacks. They were throwing stones on him and before we knew what was happening another man came with some petrol and a tyre. Without listening to the suspect the tyre was hung on his neck and he was soaked with petrol. Before one woman could bring the match that was used to set him ablaze, the suspected thief pleaded frantically in a fainted voice; a plea which the crowd was not ready to listen to. He was set on fire as he made the last attempt to struggle for survival to no avail. He was burnt to death before our very eyes.</p><p>      It was after the man had been set on fire that the woman whose money the angry mob claimed was stolen ran down to report that she had found her money. The damage already had been done and there was nobody to be held responsible as the crowd dispersed immediately.</p><p>      Sir, I think the public should be enlightened not to take the laws into their hands. They should be informed that jungle justice is against the norms of any civilized society like ours. I would be very grateful if you could take necessary steps to forestall a repeat occurrence of such an ugly incident.</p><p>                                                                                                                                  Yours faithfully,</p><p>                                                                                                                                  (Signature).</p><p>                                                                                                                                  Lawal Adekunle</p>",

        "question": "<p>Write an article for inclusion in one of your local newspapers on the importance of immunization against childhood diseases in your locality.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                         IMMUNIZATION IN OUR LOCALITY</p><p>       Immunization. which is a means of making adults and small children resist deadly and killer diseases, is very important in our locality. Several years ago. a lot of children were lost to several ravaging killer diseases like measles, small pox, whooping cough and diarrhoea in their infancy. It was fashionable then to tag these children 'abiku' or `ogbanje' because parents did not know that their children should be prevented from these deadly diseases. However, with the discovery of the various vaccines which. when injected into the body. can protect peoples especially children against deadly diseases, many people have embraced the immunization programme.</p><p>      It is very important that our people should see immunization of children as the only way to prevent the outbreak of these killer diseases. Looking around our locality. one can see that many women have suffered greatly from children whom they erroneously called 'abiku' They quickly get old after undergoing several laborious child labours with no child or one or two children to show for it. It is high time our people embraced immunization of their children. Gone are the days when people hid when immunization officials arrived our locality.</p><p>      Furthermore, we have a lot to gain and nothing to lose if we allow our children to be immunized A child immunized against these deadly diseases will grow to become a healthy adult. Therefore if our locality can allow its children to be immunized. infant mortality will be reduced and healthy and energetic youths will emerge out of these children to replace the old labour force in the farm.</p><p>      Immunization. to my mind is what we seriously need in our- community. It will assist in reducing the incidence of children's deformity in our society. A lot of children have been dealt a deadly blow by diseases like polio, measles and small pox and as a result of this, they are unable to use their legs It is expedient, therefore, that we should reduce drastically the alarming rate of which our children grow up to become handicapped.</p><p>      Finally, our women should be encouraged to surrender their children for immunization whenever the local government immunization officials come to our locality to vaccinate the children The advantages of immunization cannot be quantified. If we do not want to be left behind by the whole world and we do not want to continue to lose our children to these ravaging diseases which are preventable. we should embrace immunization</p><p>                                                                                                                                   Njoku lfeanyi</p><p>                                                                                                                                   SS 3B.</p>",

        "question": "<p>You have been invited to lead the motion in a school debate for or against the proposition that' the new 6-3-3-4 system of education will be beneficial to the youths of Nigeria'. Write out your speech.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>         THE NEW 6-3-3-4 SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE YOUTHS OF NIGERIA</p><p>      Good day, Mr. Chairman, Panel of Judges Co-debaters, Ladies and Gentlemen I am Seyi Ogundimu of Oke-Ogun Grammar School. I am standing before you to propose the motion that states that, the new 6-3-3-4 system of education will be beneficial to the Nigerian youths\".</p><p>      To start with, what is the new 6-3-3-4 system all about? It is a new system of education introduced by the government recently to emphasize the need to acquire practical training and technological know-how in the area of woodworking, bricklaying and welding while undergoing theoretical teachings in secondary schools. I believe firmly that the system is fashioned to assist our youths in particular and the country at large.</p><p>      The youths are bound to gain immensely from the 6-3-3-4 system because it encourages them to acquire skills in areas other than academic. After spending the first three years in secondary school. our youths would have acquired some technical skills in sundry technical lines like wood making, carpentry and dressmaking. Even when a child cannot cope academically, he can attend a technical school or a polytechnic where the technical skill he has acquired can be sharpened. In this way, such a child will not become a dropout and unemployable.</p><p>      Moreover .the new system will go a long way to reduce unemployment in our country. The rate of unemployment among university graduates is very alarming. If the young graduates had learnt a trade or acquired a technical skill while in secondary school, such a skill would have been able to keep them going even when they are unable to get white collar jobs. The new system will in this way make youths who are engineers, accountants, teachers and other professionals to be more useful in the society if they can also acquire the technical knowledge and skills in bricklaying, welding etc.</p><p>      Furthermore, the 6-3-3-4 system will make our youths to be good in all aspects of education. While we are going to have those who are interested in acquiring technical skills, some other youths will be privileged to blend their academic credentials with useful technical skills. This development will really reduce our dependence on foreign expatriates. A few years ago, some Indians and Pakistanis technicians flooded the country and they were highly paid at the expense of our people. You will agree with me, Ladies and Gentlemen that this has to stop. The only way to stop this is by encouraging our youths to acquire these technical skills.</p><p>      Definitely, youths are the leader's of tomorrow and the future of our country rests on them and if we want them to be able to take up the leadership positions in future, the 6-3-3-4 system of education is the best that can benefit them.</p><p>      I hope, with all the points I have put forward, I have been able to convince you that the 6-3-3-4 system will be more beneficial to the youths in Nigeria.</p><p> </p>",

        "question": "<p>You and a group of school mates were returning from an excursion when the bus in which you were travelling broke down in an isolated place. Write a report for the principal on the events that followed and how you got out of the situation.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>            REPORT ON TOURIST SOCIETY'S EXCURSION TO ORIWO EXCAVATION SPOT.</p><p>      We got to Oriwo Excavation spot safely in the afternoon on the day we set out on the journey. We were conducted round the excavation spot.* the curator who took pains to explain the significance and the dates of the various ancient carvings and sculptures to us. We enjoyed every bit of our stay there and many hitherto abstract historical artifacts with lithe information on them were explained to us.</p><p>      However, we had some problems on the road when we were coming back. We departed Oriwo Excavation spot about 4.00pm that day and we had the intention of getting back to the school by 7.00pm since the journey would have not taken us more than three hours. After travelling for about thirty kilometres, we had our first hitch. Our school bus had a punctured tyre and it took us about thirty minutes to replace it. When we finished replacing the tyre, we continued in the journey. The school driver had to increase the speed of the bus so that we could get to school on time as he had promised that we would get home before half past seven in the evening.</p><p>      Man proposes but God disposes. As ill luck would have it, after covering another twenty kilometres on the isolated road, we had another disappointment. This time around it was engine problem. Earlier on, we had been in the high spirits as the school kombi bus was surging forward at high velocity. But suddenly, the bus started jerking and its speed was reducing until it finally jerked to a halt.</p><p>      Mr. Claudius, the school driver got down, opened the engine compartment and adjusted the wire on the battery. After doing this, he jumped into the driver's seat and tried to start the engine to no avail. He got down again and after checking other parts of the engine to detect the cause of the breakdown, he told us that the bus could not move from that place unless a mechanic worked on the engine.</p><p>      When we heard this, we became despondent because there was nobody that could help. The students came down from the bus and as it was getting dark, we lost all hope. Suddenly, like a bolt out of the blue we noticed a car coming towards us and our hope rose once again The car almost passed us before it stopped and reversed to where we were. A man came out of the car and helped us to check the engine. After joining a loose wire under the engine with another, he asked Mr. Claudius to start the engine. Fortunately, the engine roared to life again. We demanded to know the identity of the man and he told us that he is an automobile engineer. He also told us that he is an alumnus of our school and that he felt that he should help us when he saw the name of our school written on the bus.</p><p>      This is how we got over the problems we encountered as we came back from our recent excursion to Oriwo Excavation spot.</p>",

How are you? I hope that you are doing very fine. I received your letter last week in which you asked me to tell you my favourite Nigerian dish and how it is prepared.</p><p>      My favourite food is pounded yam which is also the favourite food of my town's people. Among my people, pounded yam is regarded as the king of all food. It is taken most especially in the afternoon or in the evening because it is rather heavy and it takes some time to prepare. I like pounded yam so much that I can take it three times in a day especially if I have the usual melon soup that most people love to eat pounded yam with.</p><p>      As I said earlier on. pounded yam takes some time to prepare. We need some tubers of yam to make it. The number of tubers depends on the number of people who are going to eat it and their appetite. The yam will be peeled and sliced into small pieces after which it is washed and arranged neatly in a cooking pot. Some water is poured in to the Pot to boil the yam on fire. When the yam is perfectly boiled for about fifty minutes, It is ready for pounding.</p><p>      The most arduous part of the preparation of pounded yam is pounding which requires a lot of strength and skill. Two or more people are usually engaged in the pounding depending on the number of people who are going to eat and the size of the mortar used. The boiled yams are pounded with pestles which land on the yams at a quick succession. Hot water is added to the pounded yam from time to time until it. becomes succulent and supple for eating. Then the pounded yam is ready for serving into plates.</p><p>      Meanwhile, the melon stew or soup must have been equally prepared with all necessary ingredients and meat. When the stew is done and ready, it will also be served for consumption. Pounded yam goes with many types of stews but I prefer melon stew anytime, any day. Pounded yam with melon stew or even any stew for that matter is a pleasant delicacy which anybody will enjoy.</p><p>      I know that you will enjoy eating pounded yam if you try to prepare it. I have one belief that pounded yam is a good food for all races. I would want you to write me very soon and tell me about your own favourite American dish.</p><p>      Extend my sincere greetings to every member of your family.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                                   Yours sincerely,</p><p>                                                                                                                                   Kola.</p>",

Many of these have almost perfected the art of growing grains side by side with raising animals like goats, sheep, cows, horses and donkeys.
