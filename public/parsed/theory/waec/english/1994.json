Having spent six years in the school and having followed the trend of events and academic records in the school, I feel the urge to let you know the strengths and weaknesses of the school so that you can work on how to improve them. <br>\n      There is no doubt that the school can boast of a good administrative system. Your excellent administrative skill has brought about the cooperation between the teaching and non-teaching staff. The Students Representative Council which you have allowed to exist so as to voice out students' need from time to time has contributed to the great cooperation between the entire staff and students of this school. This has brought about the peaceful environment, devoid of the usual wranglings and agitations which some schools around us are experiencing. <br>\n      In addition to this, our school has several academic laurels to its credit. When it comes to academic competitions like literary debates and quiz, our school usually comes out on top position. This is evident in several prizes that we have won. <br>\n      The standard of discipline in the school is very high. The teachers are highly disciplined and hardworking. The students are also disciplined. They come to school very early and there are just few cases of some students misbehaving in and outside the school.<br>\n      However, the school has some weaknesses which I would like to draw your attention to. The school's performance in sports competitions is very poor. In the last five years, the school has not gone for any sports competition let alone winning a prize. This is not good enough. Why the students are not good in sports is that the school does not have a field where students can play football and practise other games. <br>\n      Furthermore, the School's Senior Secondary Certificate Examination results have always been on the average. I still believe that we can do better as there is always room for improvement. We can do this if you could request for more teachers from the Teaching Service Commission and improve the school's library. The library is too small and the essential books are lacking. <br>\n      Moreso, to improve the performance of the school, you could as well look at the school laboratories, They are not adequately equipped. In most cases, as you know, the science teachers always go to borrow science equipment from neighboring schools whenever there is going to be practicals. I would be very grateful if you could look into the areas of the school's weaknesses and improve on them. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yours faithfully, <br>\n                                                                                                                                      (signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yetunde Adeyemo. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Write an article for publication in a literary magazine on the need to promote the study of the indigenous languages of your country.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>            THE NEED TO PROMOTE THE STUDY OF INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES IN NIGERIA. <br>\n      It is a pity that Nigeria's indigenous languages have been relegated to the background over the years. Nigerian students are taught in English Language which is also regarded as the lingua franca of the country. This is not good enough. Though Nigeria has several indigenous languages, there is need to promote the study of these indigenous languages. <br>\n      This is why the Federal Ministry of Education made it compulsory for every student to study at least one Nigerian language at the Senior Secondary School level. Even during the tenure of Professor Babs Fafunwa as the Minister of Education, it was canvassed that indigenous languages should be used to teach primary school students. <br>\n      Languages are associated with culture and tradition of the people. Therefore, the adoption of another people's language as a medium of communication in Nigeria indicates that we have relegated our own culture and tradition to the background. This may also connote that we have not, as a country, thrown away every relic of colonization. <br>\n      Indigenous languages, if promoted, can be the unifying factor in Nigeria. They promote peaceful co-existence and tolerance among the Nigerian people who will have a sense of belonging in the country. In addition, indigenous languages also promote understanding and appreciation of our own culture and tradition. Why do we have to promote the culture of a foreign country at the expense of our own? <br>\n      The promotion and study of indigenous languages will also give us national identity. A language is always associated with a nation. So, if we promote and study our own indigenous languages, the world will identify us with these indigenous languages.<br>\n      There are lots of benefits to gain from promoting our indigenous languages. The lingua franca which we have been clamouring for over the years will ultimately emerge if we can promote the study of these indigenous languages. Furthermore, the study of these languages will enable our children to be conversant with their mother tongues since thoughts and language can hardly be separated. <br>\n      Finally, it is an established fact that a learner first thinks in the language of his environment, and this process of thinking enriches his experience about his immediate environment and culture. Hence, a thorough foundation must be i laid in the study of our indigenous languages in the country. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>ARMED ROBBERY IS A WORSE ENEMY OF OUR COUNTRY THAN BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION</p><p><br>\n      Chairman Panel of Judges, accurate Time Keeper m co-debaters. Ladies and Gentlemen and fellow students, good morning. am standing before you to oppose the motion \"bribery and corruption are worse enemies of Nigeria than armed robbery\". Though bribery and corruption and armed robbery are both serious social malaise plaguing our society, one is more grievous than the other in terms of the dangers they constitute in the country. <br>\n      Bribery i and corruption is a mere form of gratification to get an unmerited favour from somebody or a place while armed robbery is a serious crime of forcibly dispossessing another person of his property using guns and other weapons of coercion. Armed robbery is a more serious crime and even the government recognises it as such. This is why successive governments over the years have always executed armed robbers publicly as a deterrent to others. <br>\n      Armed robbers have killed many people in the country and maimed several others. Several people who would have contributed to the development of the country have been killed or rendered useless by armed robbers. Foreigners and business experts from other countries who have come to invest in the country are not spared. Many foreigners have been killed by armed robbers, thus giving the country a bad image while scaring the foreigners away from the country. This has had a serious and devastating effect on the country. <br>\n      Similarly. Nigerians always live in fear. Armed robbery is a daily occurrence in the country. Nobody knows when i these armed robbers will strike. Nigerians are not safe during the day or night as they walk during the day in fear and sleep with one eye closed at night. Armed robbery is the greatest scourge of all the social malaise. <br>\n      Bribery and corruption is harmless compared to armed robbery. Armed robbery stigmatizes the country; nobody wants to identify with a country with a high record of armed robbery. It is a thorn in the flesh of the Nigerian. society which attracts the attention of the government more than bribery and corruption. It also constitutes a clog in the wheel of social and economic development of the country. <br>\n      I believe strongly that with the above mentioned points. I have been able to convince you that armed robbery is the worst enemy of the country. I thank you for your patience. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                              MY INVOLVEMENT IN THE ROBBERY INCIDENT <br>\n      The incident which led to several criticisms of my role involved four of our friends. I have been under severe criticisms and pressure from almost all my friends except you who asked to know my role in the incident. <br>\n      The incident started one afternoon when we were in our room pretending to be observing our siesta. My other four friends, Bode, Tunde, Kunle, Gbenga and I could not sleep. We were discussing various issues concerning our school when our discussion drifted to the school poultry and orchard It didn't take us too long to arrive at the general belief of the majority of the students that we are not benefiting from the school poultry and orchard as expected. My friends and I then planned to sneak into the school poultry and steal some eggs and fowls. <br>\n      We concluded the plan to jump into the poultry farm through the fence around 11:00 pm at night after the light-out. Before the end of the siesta. we consummated the plan and we went about the other school activities without going back on what we agreed upon.<br>\n      After light-out on the day we planned to execute our intention we set out on our plan. We sneaked out of the dormitory under the cover of the dark night, and moved towards the school poultry farm. We jumped into the poultry farm through the back high walled fence with great thuds. Soon after landing n the farm -house without sustaining any injury, we moved towards the store where eggs are stored in crates <br>\n      We packed many crates of eggs and loaded in our nylon bags with the aim of moving towards the cages where we intended to steal some fowls. It was while trying to take some fowls that the night guard woke up and flashed his torchlight in our direction. We felt as if the ground should swallow us because the punishment will be grievous if we were caught. <br>\n      Out of fear we took to our heels and struggled to run out of sight towards the fence through which we came into the farm. When we got to the fence all my friends were able to scale it out of the farm while I was caught by the night guard while struggling to jump with a nylon bag full of eggs. <br>\n      I was taken to our housemaster that night and my name was written down after which I was released to go to my room. When I got to our room, my friends were on their beds pretending to be snoring The next morning, before we went for the assembly, they initially begged me to spare them by not mentioning their names whenever I was called for questioning I told them frankly that it would be impossible not to mention their names because the night guard had seen them when we were running away in fright. <br>\n      What they are castigating me for now is that I mentioned the names of my co-offenders. My explanations that I couldn't but mention their names fell on deaf ears. I believe that since we committed the offence together, we should be punished for it since our attempt to steal from the school farm failed. I hope that you will understand me better and do your best to explain my own side of the story to them.</p>",

Though I appreciate the confidence you have in me I disapprove of your plan to elope with Peter, your lover. I will be very frank and blunt with you because I still don't know what brought that kind of inglorious plan to your mind. <br>\n      How do you think that you are going to be respected by your junior brothers and sisters if you carry out your plan? Nobody respects a lady who elopes with her lover against her parents' wishes. Don't you realize that you are laying down a bad example which should not be emulated? What befits you as the eldest daughter in the family is to wed a man of your choice with the approval of daddy and mummy. Moreover, if you elope with your lover now, how do you expect him to respect you? I am sure you are going to regret it later in life because those who have carried out what you are planning now ended up being dumped by their husbands.<br>\n      Secondly, you are going to bring a stigma into the family. I want you to think seriously about your parents whom you want to disgrace and put to shame in our town. I advise you not to bring such ridicule to our parents. It is abominable and unheard i of in the annals of our town for a young beautiful girl like you to elope with a man whom her parents do not approve of. <br>\n      Thirdly, the bible goes against your plan. As a christian, you are expected to be joined to a man of your choice whom your parents approve of. This means that if you carry out your plan, you will be committing a sin towards God. Therefore, you have to be careful and change your plan. <br>\n      In order to obtain our parents' consent, I want you to go and see uncle Ade. As you know that daddy and mummy always listen to him, go and tell him that you are in love with Peter and that you are convinced that he loves you too. Then, solicit his assistance to talk to our parents so as to convince them that irrespective of the fact that Peter doesn't belong to our tribe, you can still marry him and have joy and peace. <br>\n      I am sure that if you take this step, our parents will consent to your courtship and later marriage to Peter. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely, <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Joke. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                                                    A PATIENT DOG EATS THE FATTEST BONE <br>\n      Once upon a time, there lived two sisters who were twins. They were living with their parents who were poor. Their parents struggled everyday to make both ends meet. Their father was full of wisdom and he always created time to many counsel his daughters about the need to be patient in whatever they were doing. He talked to them about so man other virtues, like tolerance, endurance, good behavior and he always ended his talks with a saying that \"whoever had patience had everything.\" <br>\n      When these twins were eighteen years old, their father died. They felt greatly the impact of their father's demise because they lost a good companion who also counselled them and a breadwinner. Soon after the death of their father, their mother found things difficult. As a result of this. she took the twins to her distant relation who was living a few kilometres away. <br>\n      Their mother's relation accepted them but he was a cruel man who maltreated the girls so much They were to do all the house chores at home and followed the man to the farm. While they worked so hard at home, the man's only daughter will sleep endlessly. She was very lazy and spoilt. One day, Bolaji, the man's daughter went to the man's room and stole four thousand naira. The man was so furious and called the twins to his parlour. He concluded that it was the twins who must have stolen the money. They were beaten and punished heavily for the money they didn't take. <br>\n      The hard life and suffering continued for a long time. One day, Kehinde called her twin sister. Taiwo and told her that she wanted to run away to their mother. Taiwo reminded her that she should be patient as their late father used to tell them when he was alive. Kehinde refused to listen to her sister's advice, and soon after she ran back to their mother. When she got home, she couldn't continue her education because there was no money. She got married when she was twenty one to a poor man who couldn't take good care of her. Soon after her marriage, their mother also died. <br>\n      Taiwo felt the grieve of her mother's death and she determined more than ever before to be patient to get what she wanted. She finished her secondary school and gained admission into a university to study Accountancy. As time went on. the man she was living with grew to like her and he decided to sponsor her education at the university. Bolaji, the biological daughter of the man, had dropped out of secondary school and she had become a wayward and virtueless girl without a bright future. <br>\n      Taiwo finished her university education and graduated as an Accountant. Three years after her graduation, she got married to a pilot and she lived happily with her husband. After her marriage she got a job with an international organization which necessitated that she should go and work in the United States of America. <br>\n      Before she travelled to the United States of America. a send-off party was organised for her. The man who sponsored her to school was invited to the party. Bolaji and Kehinde were also present at the party. When the man rose up to talk about Taiwo, he praised her for her endurance and patience. He ended his speech by saying that \"I really agree that a patient dog eats the fattest bone.\"</p>",

But writing is an unnatural activity; it must be taught formally and studied <ins>deliberately</ins>. Indeed, many of the problems that arise in learning to write are simply problems of finding proper written equivalent for the various features of speech.

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.</p><p> <br>\n      Between 1921 and 1930, the population of Jos town rose from 8.000 to 11.000. These were very important years in the history of Jos town. It was in 1921 that the administrative headquarters of Jos Division was transferred from Naraguta to Jos. In 1926, Plateau Province was created with its headquarters in Jos also. The new province was carved out of the then Mubi, Nasarawa and Bauchi provinces. Jos, therefore assumed dual administrative functions as the divisional and provincial headquarters. A crop of new employees and labourers started moving into the city to serve the two administrations respectively. During the same period, the tin mining industry was experiencing a boom. <br>\n      The boom was further buttressed by other developments in the area. In 1927, the Eastern Railway Extension reached its Jos terminus, via Kafanchan. A new era was in sight with promises of plenty for all, because the mining industry was passing through its greatest moment of prosperity. The said administrative change, the boom in the tin industry, the new communication network and similar developments on the Jos Plateau, created a myth of the wealth and prosperity in Jos. However, the boom was short-lived. By 1929 it receded, and then collapsed in 1931. The mine labourers were thrown out of employment and most of them trooped into Jos in search of food and shelter. During this depression, Jos was likened to a ghost city. The population of Jos shrank from 11,000 in 1930 to 9,000 in 1933. <br>\n      By the mid 1930, the price of tin rose in the world market and the tin industry was about to pick up once more. A new characteristic feature of the growth of Jos came into sight. This was the influx of Indians and Levantines into Jos. This continued and increased after the Second World War in 1945. These were mainly traders, transporters and middlemen who, like their European counterparts, contributed in no small measure to the exploitation of Nigerians and the economy of the country. <br>\n      The number of Europeans, up to the eve of independence in 1960, was second only to that of Lagos throughout the English-speaking West Africa. These white elements addressed themselves to the building of luxurious hotels for their exclusive use. The African elite, in their tradition as copy-cats, were not left behind. The European policy of segregation however, ensured that the Africans and the Europeans never mixed. <br>\n      The European quarters were far removed from those of Africans. The provision of social amenities followed the same pattern. Thus, there were separate African and European hospitals, schools, clubs and the like. It is interesting to note that the situation has barely changed quantitatively since independence. The Nigerian elite in the civil service and the private sector have merely moved away from their own people into the positions formerly occupied by the Europeans. <br>\n(a) In four sentences, one for each, summarize the factors that were responsible for the growth of Jos as described in the passage.</p><p>(b) In two sentences, summarize the common features of the organization of social life in Jos as described in the passage. </p>",
