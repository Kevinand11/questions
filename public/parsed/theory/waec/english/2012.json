My inability to reply to the letter on time is due to the fact that the time of its arrival coincided with the commencement of my West African Examinations Council Schools Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for May/June 2012 Nevertheless, I decided to reply to the letter at the end of the exams.</p><p>      Daddy, having spent about six weeks in this school and having followed closely the trend of events and academic records of the school, I feel the solemn urge to let you know my experiences so far in the school.</p><p>      First, the administrative set up of the school is no doubt second to none This has brought about a conducive academic atmosphere between the teaching staff and the students. The introduction of the Students Representative Council in my first week in the school has contributed in no small measure to the unparalleled cooperation between the various organs of the school. This has brought about a peaceful environment, devoid of the usual wrangling and needless agitations that characterized the administrative set up of my former school.</p><p>      Furthermore, the school's tone and standard of discipline is very high. The teachers are epitome of discipline and hard work. Hence. lazy students are compelled to ship in or ship out. They come to school very early. do all that was expected of them with minimal supervision and during school's hour. Apart from the break time. the silence enveloping the school can be compared to that of the grave yard. This disciplinary tone of the school coupled with the students academic performance make her the cynosure of all eyes.</p><p>      In addition to this, the co-curricular activities of the school are beautifully planned and implemented. Every student is compelled to be a member of at least one society or club. Each society or club is coordinated by a teacher and officers elected among the students. This has created a sense of duty and belonging among the students and between the officers and the coordinating teacher. Hence. each society or club is given specific date to present its social and academic activities to the students at a general assembly specially called for that purpose. This has brought about a spirit of cooperation and togetherness in the students.</p><p>      Daddy, I am very happy to inform you that my coming to this school is a blessing in disguise. The reasons are too many to be written in this letter but it is very important to tell you that my academic attitude has changed. Here, in the area of academics. it is the survival of the fittest, hence all hands must be on deck all the time. In my school one has little or no time for unproductive activities.</p><p>      Lastly. daddy. I want to thank you for granting me the permission to change to this school. It is not a fruitless effort. Extend my warmest regards to the rest of the family Till we meet at the end of the third term.</p><p>                                                                                                                                      Yours sincerely.</p><p>                                                                                                                                      Adejoke.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Write an article for publication in your school magazine on the dangers of keeping bad company in school.</p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>The Dangers of Keeping Bad Company in School.</strong></p><p>      It is sad to note that many young ones in schools today go out with groups that turned out to be the ones that change their good destiny.</p><p>      The holy book says: show me your friend and I will tell you who truly you are. A popular proverb also supports this statement when it says: Birds of the same feather flock together.</p><p>      According to the English Advanced Learners Dictionary a company is a group of people with a common set of goals and objectives, while a school is a place created in order to acquire knowledge that would make a learner a better and useful person to himself and others in future.</p><p>      One important cornerstone that needs individual contribution is the choice of a company to stay with. A company is by choice and not by force. Today. in most of our schools. students select companies without weighing the social, political economic and educational gains of such relationship They end up regretting their actions. Some of them started games whose end they do not know Usually they end in shame that may be difficult to remedy. Examples abound in society where students from good homes turned to wolves with human skin.</p><p>      Therefore it is very important to itemize factors that generate bad company its effect and what can be done to curb or put an end to it</p><p>      Many factors contribute to the growth of bad groups in schools in recent times Major among them are: parents attitude to their children at home wrong societal value. and the cash and carry syndrome in society.</p><p>      First, most parents fail in their God-ordained responsibility to control their children and wards at home. Some parents put this responsibility of managing their children and wards on school teachers, who themselves have a lot to</p><p>do</p><p>      Furthermore. we are in a society with wrong values, a society where survival of the fittest is the order of the day. a society without decorum.</p><p>      In addition, the materialistic state of society also contributed to this Most bad groups in schools put their focus on material liberation instead of educational liberation The result is what we are witnessing in schools today.</p><p>      The dangers of keeping bad gangs or company in school are numerous and very damaging to the academic and social souls of the school system. a place expected to be the product for the best brain needed for the development of the country.</p><p>      First, it brings about the growth of gangsterism in schools. Gangs are groups of elite students that can do anything o protect the interest of their members Gangs have destroyed the unity of many schools.</p><p>      Second, bad company is usually the birth place of many notorious cult groups we have in society today. Their activities are too numerous to mention.</p><p>      Third bad company leads to poor academic performance of students. This is due to the fact that academically poor students use it as a forum to protect their incompetence and thereby terrorize their teachers when they fail. Criminal activities that are very rampant in schools today got their roots from bad associations.</p><p>      Therefore. all stakeholders in the field of education must wake up to their responsibility of making sure that bad groups are curbed or eradicated from schools. it is in interest of everybody.</p><p> </p>",

Many of my mates do salute your courage in putting all these activities in place which are expected to shape the social and academic landscape of the school. Sir, more grease to your elbow Nevertheless. l have observed that some co-curricular activities such as debates, drama and excursions have become things of the past in schools in this country in general and in our school in particular.</p><p>      The reasons for this trend can be understood in three ways. First and foremost, the population of students in most schools are very alarming. Today. the various governments have jettisoned the old form of entrance examination, and replaced it with the automatic transfer of students from primary six to Junior Secondary School One. In addition to this is the haphazard manner in which students of Junior Secondary Schools are moved to Senior Secondary Schools, This has brought about students poor performance in debates, drama and excursions due to poor academic background of majority of the overcrowded students.</p><p>      Furthermore. fund is very important for most of these co-curricular activities But government does not encourage schools to collect money from students for the funding of these activities, while the same government will not provide enough fund that can adequately organize such activities. Also, many parents do not support co-curricular activities that can take their students out of the home for too long. They always expect their children to come back home and hawk some goods for them as part of the children's contributions to the growth and development of their nuclear or extended families Having said all these. the authority ought to be aware of the importance of debates, drama and excursions in the social and academic development of the students.</p><p>      Debates encourage students to exhibit their speaking skill in English and thereby develop this skill in them Also students who listen to good speakers can emulate them and try to do like them. Furthermore. drama, if properly channeled can turn some of the students to entertainment stars in future. Since not all the students will be opportuned to get white collar jobs after leaving school it will greatly help them in future if they start developing their gifts early.</p><p>      In addition. excursion is a medium through which what is taught in class can be seen physically The practical gains of excursion make it very important as a learning tool.</p><p>      I, therefore. appeal to you to see to it that all the co-curricular activities mentioned above are introduced. in order to increase the academic development of the students.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                                        Yours faithfully</p><p>                                                                                                                                         Adeyemi Oluwasegun</p>",

        "question": "<p>You are the Chief Speaker in a debate on the topic: Violent video games should be banned. Write your argument for or against the topic.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                <strong>Violent Video Games should be Banned.</strong></p><p>The Chairman, School Principal, Vice Principals (Administration and Academic), School Teachers, Non-Teaching Staff, Time-keeper, Co-debaters, Fellow students, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p><p>      I am writing in support of the motion that violent video games should be banned. The reasons for my support is vet obvious. I am in total support, first, because of the word 'violent' linked with video games. Video games on its own has a lot of social and academic gains if properly and timely used but if video games that are violent become the order of the day, the outcome is always not palatable.</p><p>      However. for the past few years particularly with introduction of cell phones and  field computers,l of education. the use of violent video games has been a controversial issue in Nigeria among stakeholders in the field of education. Also, different medical. moral. legal and religious bodies and organizations have aired their views concerning this topical issue. While some stakeholders supported the idea, some vehemently go against it. However, various bodies and organization see many ills in it.</p><p>      Violent games are video games with lots of activities that tend to portray life as beginning and ending in on( see many ills in it. physical power and attributes only. We all know that this assumption is not correct. This is why I have come to support </p><p>the motion that violent video games should be banned.</p><p>      In the first place, future leaders must not be tutored with violence. Nothing can be achieved at permanent level in a state of anarchy. A lot of human and material resources are often wasted in violent activities, hence it must not be supported.</p><p>      Second. in our society today, gangsterism. cultism, armed robbery. kidnapping and other criminal activities have become a way of life. This is made possible and easy in a society that encourages and supports violent video games. In my candid opinion, video games is bad and not to talk of adding violence to it.</p><p>      Ladies and gentlemen, all the ills in our society can be traced to the doorstep of violent video games. A person that got himself or herself addicted to video game habit is a moving train with no clear-cut destination. The destination is a disaster for the train and people around it. Hence, all hands must be on the deck to rid club houses of illicit video games.</p><p>      In schools, many students behave like touts and uncultured persons due to the type of materials they watch. A wise man says that a person's destiny can be developed or destroyed by the things he sees. Therefore, a man that sees good things act in a good way while a man that sees bad things is expected to behave and act likewise.</p><p>      Moreover. if we want our country's future and future of generations yet unborn to be in safe hands, we must discourage violent video game from our environment.</p><p>      Lastly, many people have argued that violent video games can be useful in military services and situations. We all know that this is not a gospel truth.</p><p>      I hope I have convinced you that violent video games should be banned. Thank you very much</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Chiazor Uwuchukwu</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Suru Senior High School</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Ilasamaja.

        "answer": "<p><strong>Where there is a will, there is a way</strong></p><p>      Adewumi and Morenikeji got married twenty years ago in the village of Mosan. a stone-throw from the political and cultural capital of the Yoruba people - Ile-Ife Adewumi, the husband came from a polygamous home of seven wives. Her mother. Aderinto was the fifth in the roll call of the wives He was the first son of her mother and nineteenth child of the family. Adewumi s father. Ogundeji was an hunter while her mother was a produce buyer and supplier.</p><p>      Morenikeji on the other hand came from a monogamous family, which was very rare in those days. Her father, Ogungbemi and her mother Abeke was the first couple to be converted to Christianity in their village. They attended a Roman Catholic Church in Ososun about ten kilometers to their own village. Their Christian background shaped their attitude to life and to many issues of the day which people at that time regarded as very important.</p><p>      From the family backgrounds of Adewumi and Morenikeji it was very clear that the two of them are miles apart in every area of human endeavour. The only common denominator between them was love.</p><p>      After years of marital bliss, they could not have a child they could call their own The husband's family invited him to a very crucial meeting. At the meeting they tongue-lashed him on his inability to be a 'man that is, Morenikeji, could not give them a child.</p><p>      Adewumi appealed to them not to muddle things, and that he and his wife were waiting for God's time The family. rather than respect their point of view threatened to resort to other means When they could not force the hand of time they decided to call on a very powerful local herbalist, lfagbemi, to assist them in removing the logs in the eyes of their son. Adewumi. They were of the opinion that Morenikeji has charmed him with something that did not allow him to know the difference between the good and the bad.</p><p>      Since Adewumi and Morenikeji were committed Christians they sought the eyes of Jesus and believed that He is the only one that can help them in resolving many problems confronting them as individuals and as a family. They always attended all the services in their local church and even went to crusades and rallies organized by other Christian churches with the hope that one good day. there would be an end to the many problems facing them, particularly their search for the fruit of the womb.</p><p>      Adewumi s family decided that the ultimate prize death should be the fate of Morenikeji but all their efforts were in vain. At long last and at the appropriate time in the eyes of God. He gave a bouncing baby boy to them.

He decided that this time, he would give them the rough edge of his tongue.  They had come because earlier callers had not reported what he had stressed:  that he was not in Kapitatown for anyone's sake.</p><p>      He took his time to put his office and workshop in order. determined not to leave in a hurry just because of some stubborn fortune-seekers. He made sure that all his seventy-two workers had signed out before he signaled to his driver.

That would be the ultimate  solution to the persistent problem of the traffic congestion which he faced in Kapitatown.</p><p>      The five-kilometre distance to his mansion was covered in about two hours.

As soon as the chit-chat ended,  they announced that the Ireti ruling council had decided to confer on him the highest traditional title of the land and that a date had been set for the great event.

The house had been turned into a museum by one of the several organizations  that fought the scourge Among the most outstanding features of the museum were the several statues of slaves in different postures black slaves being captured in their native homes, being chained together, being led to the port for sale, on the slave ship and being forced to work on plantations The sculptures were particularly remarkable  in that they illustrated very movingly the bane which Wilberforce threw himself against.</p><p>      As a black man I could not help shedding tears when going from room to room on the two floors. Then, there was a period of pandemonium which I. unwittingly, caused. I was on the first floor, about to cross the lobby, when I came face to face with another visitor. a white man. When he saw me, a wave of fright swept through him.  His eyes were immediately bloodshot. He shouted out of fright and ran back. Quickly, he made for the staircase, sped down to the ground floor, and took to his heels.</p><p>      All this while. I remained still, at a loss as to the cause of his action. He stopped shouting only when he got into the bus that brought his group.  Meanwhile. others around him. realizing the cause of his fright, came to tell me that I was</p><p>the cause. They laughed it off when they told me that he had thought I was one of the statues and. had left suddenly turned into a human being. I discovered the reason for his fright when I entered the room which he had just left and found that It one of the statues looked exactly like me. Whoever did the wax model perhaps had my picture. was my height, my shape, my complexion, indeed the exact replica of me.</p><p>      I realized what had happened. I was the only black present in the building. The man had not expected a live black person to be in the museum. Thus, the sudden sight of a black person moving around, with the stature and face of one of the statues, should certainly frighten him. I wondered what could have happened if I had pursued  him down the staircase.</p><p>(a) In what capacity did the writer visit the museum?</p><p>(b) For what was William Wilberforce famous?</p><p>(c) Why did the writer stand out among the visitors in the museum at that hour?</p><p>(d) Why was the other man frightened?</p><p>(e) by had the man assumed that the writer was a statue that had come alive?</p><p>(f) \"a wave of fright swept through him...\" (i) What figure of speech is contained in the expression above?

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.</p><p>      The number of people living in slums worldwide is estimated to be more than a billion. Experts in urbanization fear that the ever-growing slums in the world will soon become more populous than the cities. Findings like these, however. do not show clearly the devastating effect which substandard living conditions have on the poor. The situation is more serious in developing countries, where many people lack basic amenities, adequate housing and modem health care services.</p><p>      It is an irony that while some of the richest nations want to build colonies on the moon and explore Mars, growing numbers of their poorest citizens cannot afford a decent place to live here on earth. It might be easy to conclude that the poor could remedy their situation if they showed more initiative. but factors involved in the housing crisis are beyond their control. The world's population is increasing at an alarming rate. such that millions of houses are needed to keep pace with this development.</p><p>      It is a fact that cities provide more facilities than the rural areas. It is easier to get electricity and good water supply, pursue one's education and secure well-paid jobs in cities than villages. Very often those in the villages hanker for such opportunities. One cannot therefore blame them when they seize the first opportunity to reside n the cities. They do not mind going away from the villages to reside in congested cities. thereby contributing to over-population in the cities. In troubled areas of the world. political disasters. civil wars and suicide bombing are common Poor people, women and children run away from such troubled areas to preserve their lives They seek refuge in whatever shelter they can find when existing buildings are completely destroyed The relationship between housing and poverty cannot be ignored. People who cannot afford basic necessities as food and clothing. may not be able to rent or build decent houses. These and other factors have forced millions of people to settle for substandard housing They live in abandoned buses, shipping containers, cardboard boxes and other unthinkable places.</p><p>The housing problems. just like many other problems facing the world should be tackled with urgency. However, the cost of land for the erection of houses is high Even when land is secured. the high cost of building materials is another problem to contend with. One must not therefore blame building agencies which employ methods that enable them to build inexpensive houses</p><p>(a) In five sentences, one for each state the causes of the worldwide housing problems.</p><p>(b) In one sentence. summarize the measures that poor people have adopted to solve their housing problem.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) The population of the world is increasing.</p><p>(ii) The cities are congested/over-populated,</p><p>(iii) Disasters destroy 3' existing buildings/houses/shelters.</p><p>(iv) Some people are so poor that they cannot rent/build decent houses.</p><p>(v) Land and building materials are expensive</p><p>(b) They live in make shift structures/all kinds of places.</p><p>.</p>",
