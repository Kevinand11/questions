        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>KOBINA SEKYI: The Blinkards. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Analyse the character of Mr. Onyimdze</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Mr. Onyimdze is a young unmarried barrister. He is educated in England. Despite his education Mr. Onyimdze has a bias for the African way of life. By his training he is a lawyer, a typical western profession. In his colonial environment, Mr. Onyimdze must strike a balance between the Whiteman's way of life and that of his own people. As a lawyer, Mr. Onyimdze cannot but dress in his legal robes when he goes to court. Yet his inclination towards the traditional way of life makes him eager to be out of European clothing when he is out of court. His favourite wear at home is the native cloth with native sandals to match. </p><p>Mr. Onyimdze's favourite games are also traditional. For example he prefers ampe to tennis croquet and antsally, all of which he is familiar with because of his English training. At the garden party he guesses that the people will be playing tennis and other non-African games and wonders whether Mrs. Borofosem will let the young ladies play \"ampe\" His love for his native language-Fante-makes him believe that Mr. Okadu should speak Fante at the party. He also loves traditional foods. When the girls harass him and put pressure on him to wear English clothes, he resists them and tries to dissuade them from following Mrs. Borofosem blindly. And when the Girls ridicule him for wearing native cloth exposes his 'nakedness, he educates them on the difference between \"nakedness\" and\" bareness\". </p><p>Mr. Onyimdze's dislike of English manners as portrayed by Mrs. Borofosem is clear. During Mr. Okadu's romance with Miss Tsiba, he insists that Mr. Okadu should do the right thing and threatens to sack him if he does not express his intensions towards Miss Tsiba in the customary way. Mr. Onyimdze's respect for tradition and the elders is total. That enable him to intervene in the matter between Nana Katawerwa and the parson. The meeting in Mr. Onyimdize's office ends in the disgrace of the parson who misquotes the Bible. Thus, Mr. Oniymdze comes off as one who is able to accommodate western values without sacrificing his own traditional way of life. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>KOBINA SEKYI: The Blinkards. </strong></p><p> </p><p>To what extent is Mrs. Borofosem a blind imitator of the English ways of life? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Mrs. Borofosem is a major character in the play. She is the wife of Mr. Borofosem who belongs to the merchant class. She is a been-to', that is one who has been to England, albeit for only three months. She claim to be a leader of fashion and insists on speaking English, Although, her own English is, at best, sub-standard. </p><p>Mrs. Borofosem is a blind imitator of English ways of life. For her, everything African is barbaric, and that includes African dress, food, languages, customs and religion. For instance, she insists on kissing her husband openly (even though he is reluctant to do so) and demands that he call her \"Duckie\" as her neighbour, Mr.. Gosh in England, calls his wife. She even goes to the ridiculous length of encouraging her husband to smoke and spill the cigar ashes on the carpet in the belief that it preserves the carpet against moth. </p><p>There is no finesse in Mrs. Borofosem's affectation of English ways. She seems more to be putting on appearances. She insists on having \"European sweets\" with dinner. But in her unguarded moments she is nostalgic the African dishes she condemns openly. Her fixation on English manners is complete: her husband must sing as the English do even if he insists on singing in his own natural voice. \"I' m not an ass\" he says. Mrs. Borofosem's attitude to her servants apes what she sees as the attitude of the English people to their servants. For her, \"Nobody thinks of servants thinking in England.\" </p><p>Perhaps the most ridiculous thing about Mrs. Borofosem is her taking pride in using English, a language she speaks poorly. For a character like her who dotes on English, her grammatical slips are as ridiculous as her other affectations. All these create a picture of her as a pretentious, ridiculous and ludicrous character. Yet it is to Mrs. Borofosem's affection credit that towards the end of the play,. She makes an about-turn towards embracing her native language and customs. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>FEMI OSOFISAN: Women of Owu</strong></p><p> </p><p>Justify the assertion that the people of Owu are the architects of their own destruction. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>It can be argued that the people of Owu are the architects of their own doom. Their history lends some proof. The plight of Owu has both remote and immediate causes. Prominent among these are the prophesy of the birth of the Prince; the attack on Ife; Owu's engagement in slavery, the sack of Apomu and the desecration of the Anlugbua shrine by the allied forces.</p><p>By prophesy, Prince Dejumo will bring destruction to his own people. The natural thing to do, accordingly to tradition, is to destroy the child at birth. However, Erelu, his mother, he is permitted to live and he does fulfill his destiny.</p><p>Regarding the attack on Ife, Owu, full not pride, complacency and greed commits sacrilege. In sacking Ife, Owu sells into slavery her kith and kin and incurs the wrath of the gods. Similarly, the sacking of Apomu market by Owu warriors who take away their women as booty, including the abduction of lyunloye, is Owu's own doing and undoing, for it gets punished. Again when the Allied forces avenge their dead, they too overreact by pursuing the fugitives to Anlugbua's shrine, killing the priest and desecrating the shrine. For this they pay a heavy price by being decimated on their way back home. They too are directly responsible for what happens to them.</p><p>Owu's rise and fall can therefore be blamed not on the gods but on the people themselves who do not heed the gods' instructions and individually and collectively pursue their own interests. </p>",

On the one hand there are the two women of Owu and those of allied forces who are devastated by the wars, and on the other, the goddess Lawumi who, by losing her shrine, loses her status. lyunloye, also suffers disgrace and ridicule. The play emphasizes the plight of Owu women during and after the destruction of the Owu kingdom. They are subjected to disgrace, humiliation, grief and sorrow. They lose their husbands, sons and properties to the war. Their various prestigious positions as wives and mothers change to those of slaves and concubines sent to unknown destinations. <br>\n </p><p>Erelu, the queen of Owu, in particular, witnesses the death of her husband, sons, and daughter and eventually buries her grandson. She suffers degradation and disgrace, torture and displacement by the invasion of the allied forces. She is to be sent to Balogun Derin to serve as maid to his wife. While leading the rite which is performed for the transition of the spirits of the dead, Erelu is possessed by the god, Anlugbua, pronounces the doom of Owu kingdom and dies.</p><p>Now the women of Owu must be marched off into exile and slavery. It is this terrible fate which befalls them as they suffer in agony the consequences of their collective misdeeds: Our women were sized/And shared out to the blood-splattered/ troops /To spend the night.\" As for the goddess Lawumi, the allied forces plunder and desecrate her shrine, while lyunloye looks to an uncertain future as the price she pays for her infidelity. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Raina, the only daughter of Paul and Catherine Petkoff, is a very beautiful lady of about twenty-three years old. She appears in the play as a lively and articulate lady. But one who is also given to fantasizing about love and war. For example, she is attracted to Sergius precisely because she believes war is a theater for heroic exploits. Similarly, she is drawn to Bluntschil for about the same reason, he being a soldier. Raina is also very intelligent and brave; she allows Bluntschli, a total stranger into her room and shield him, a great personal risk, from being discovered by the search party. Her taking to Bluntschli partly reflects her intelligence and her capacity to argue, as well as accommodate opposing view. </p><p>Apart from being intelligent and brave; there is spontaneity in her nature that enables her to adapt more readily to changing situations. In that she is in sharp contrast with the more calculating Louka. Raina is also an attention-seeker. She knows how to make use of opportunities that project her in a positive light. When, for instance. Sergius returns from the war, she times her appearance to coincide with his asking after her. It is to Raina's credit that her character develops in the play. She is increasingly seen as one who is honest enough to recognize her mistaken ideals about war and love. She is able to come to terms with the mutual attraction between Sergius and Louka and this allows him to follow his hearts desire. In equal measure, she accepts the fact that her relationship with Sergius is based on social class, which excludes her own feelings, thus she is able to welcome Bluntschli's proposal of marriage. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The Petkoffs are Major Paul, Catherine, his wife, and Raina, their daughter. Louka and Nicola are their servants. one being a maid and the other, a man-servant. The two groups constitute a relationship best described as that of master and servant. The Petkoffs are high social standing, educated and wealthy. Their relationship with their servants must be seen it this light. Their behaviour and comportment portrays the presumptuousness of their class. </p><p>They talk down to their servants whom they assume are unintelligent and have no ambition. The servants on the other hand have more intelligence than the Petkoffs credit them with. For example, Nicola is a very wily character. He is perceptive enough to recognize Louka's potential and the possibility of propelling herself into the higher class. Thus while the Petkoffs think he is engaged to Louka, Nicola is in fact counting on Louka's future patronage. </p><p>There is also an air of frivolity about the Petkoffs' manners and language. They pretend they know so much about the arts-libraries, exhibitions, war etc while their conversations ramble on meaninglessly on these issues. Compared with the Petkoffs, the servants are more purposeful. Louka for example, would stand up to Raina in addressing her on first name basis, indicating her scorn, if not outright disrespect of the high-handedness of the Petkoffs in their relationship with their servants. It needs to be emphasized that Louka refuses to accept the position which the Petkoffs believe she must occupy. She is ambitious and is intent on rising to the upper class. She is Raina's rival. for Sergius's love without Raina knowing it. Thus, Raina, in her complacency, gives Louka the opportunity to her advantage. She reveals Raina's apparent infidelity to Sergius and is therefore able to scheme her way into Sergius's arms. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Algernon is one of the major characters in the play. He is an aristocrat, born into a wealthy and noble family. His late mother was a sister to the fashionable lady Bracknell. </p><p>Algernon is an easy-going young man who takes delight in deception, fun and pleasure. He confides in Jack his love for levity. He invents \"bunburism\", his own idea of leading a double life. He tells Jack that he invents an invaluable permanent invalid called \"Bunbury\" in order that he may be able to go down to the countryside whenever he chooses. Algernon shirks his responsibility at home when he pretends to be going to see his imaginary friend called Mr. Bunbury. </p><p>Algernon deceive his aunty, Lady Bracknell, and lures her away to enable Jack have access to Gwendolen Fairfax. He also displays his deception when he goes to Jack's country home and claims to be the wayward Ernest, Jack's imaginary elder brother, just to woo Cecily, Jack's ward. He deceived his friend Jack by telling him that the cucumber sandwiches are all reserved for Lady Bracknell. But after eating all the sandwiches, he lies to his aunt that they have been unable to find any cucumber to buy in the market. He also falsely accuses the servants of negligence for not serving the cucumber. </p><p>Algernon also falsely informs Miss Prism that the Priest is waiting for her in the garden. He does this to send her away so that he can talk to Cecily in private. He leads the way in deception and instructs Cecily in how to deceive people in order to get what she wants. All in all, we can say that Algernon is a. character who is adept at deception. The good thing, however, is he does it all without malice, but for frivolous fun and pleasure. </p>",

        "answer": "<p> Miss prism is a minor character who nevertheless plays a crucial role. She is governess to Cecily. She was also in <br>\na previous employment, a maid to General and Mrs. Moncrieff. In spite of her lowly position and status, Miss Prism holds the key to the mystery about Jack's mistaken identity in the play, after twenty-nine years of anonymity. According to her account, she, as Jack's nanny much earlier, in a moment of mental distraction, mistakenly deposits the manuscript of a novel she is writing in the bassinet and places Jack, then a baby, in the handbag instead. Then, she deposits the handbag in the cloakroom in a railway station in London. Jack is later found and nurtured by the late Mr. Thomas Cardew </p><p>Before Miss Prism's confessions, on one knows that Jack is actually an adopted child except that he is a child who has come into Mr. Cardew's home through a mistake. Jack is himself unaware of his real identity and grows up not knowing that he is Algernon's brother. This leads to much of the confusion in the play. </p><p>Miss Prism is also unaware of the implications of what she has done. The suspense in the play is heightened as the recognition of the significance of her mistake dawns on her. She confesses. The mystery is thus resolved and Jack is able to claim his inheritance. All minds are put at rest. Miss prism, as it were brings light to the darkness which has engulfed the play. Miss Prism also serves to expose the absurdity of class distinction in the play. Lady Bracknell does not include Jack in her \"list of eligible\" suitors because he does not, supposedly, have a fortune and is of low social class. Miss Prism's confession shows how wrong lady Bracknell has been and also, how ridiculous society's attitude to social class is. </p><p>Miss Prism further expose the hypocrisy of the society. Her relationship with Dr Chasuble exposes both as hypocritical and deceitful. Finally, Miss Prism's name is symbolic. Like a prism which spits a ray of light into the different colours of the rainbow, through Miss Prism, the complex web of relationships which lie at the core of the mistaken identities in the play is unraveled.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>The question isolates two groups for special comment. These are the so-called patriots and the so-called elites society. The poem states how these two groups contribute to the poverty of the masses. </p><p>In the poem these two groups are separated as a matter of convenience. However, as the first stanza demonstrates they are one and the same. The metaphor of the \"head\" and the \"anus\" demonstrates how lopsided their interests are. Instead of using their heads to serve their country, it is rather the \"left overs\" of their corrupt activities which their country men are made beneficiaries of. </p><p>Using damning language the poet describes these two groups as not worthy of the name \"saviour\". As merchants they \"loot\" to \"boost\" the economies of their colonial masters. As office holders they are; loafer', incompetent are avaricious with their kleptomaniac fingers \"and\" sucking filaments\" which turn them into predatory insects. <br>\nThey are not worthy of the name \"patriot\" who withhold from the people what is due to them until famished and hungry, they abandon conscience and power and are themselves corrupted by the affluent in the society. As th political elite, they flaunt their ill-gotten wealth in front of the people in the form of \"air conditioned chambers\" an exotic cars while their constituencies are deprived of any form of modern life- their roads are \"death traps\" they have mud for water \"candle for light\" and the children go to school under trees and lack food and nutrition. The poem successfully demonstrates how the so called patriots and elites of society have become parasites turning their countrymen into destitute in the name of governing them. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the poet's diction in \"The fence.\" </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The poet raises the serious issues of his dilemma and confusion especially on the threshold of decision-making. Accordingly he deploys appropriate diction to make his points. To this end he uses epithets that connote the uncertainty of things and a network of opposites that underscore his indecision. </p><p>For instance he finds himself helpless where 'the past and the future' are both 'dim' and \"the hopes and inspirations they raise are equally 'nebulous'. He is also confounded at that point where time ceaselessly moves 'forwards anc backwards'. There he lies unable to choose between casting away the old and embracing the new. With a skillful use of an effective network of contrasting words, he shows how he finds himself unable to take sides as he watches \"truth and untruth\" locked in an 'endless and bloody combat.' </p><p>By means of the same language technique he portrays his dilemma, confusion and indecision at the crossroads of the \"need for good\" and the need for 'doing good'. There again he lies unable to take any decision. It is also with the use of the right diction that the poet reveals how his dilemma, confusion and indecision seemingly peak, hallucinating as he feels the 'buoyant waves'; tending to 'stagger' even though he has \"not been drinking\" anc lying \"in open-souled amazement\". Helplessly watching the forces of evil descending and causing their havoc. Throughout the poem, the choice of diction which begins with the title-The Fence'-is consistent with the poet's passive disposition as he continues to sit on the fence in masters of the utmost importance. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>In the poem the soul is running errand for the poet. The errand is to convey the poet's valedictory wishes, that is, to go out and tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth to such temporal and spiritual and authorities as the court the potentates and the church as a means of calling them to order. </p><p>The poet believes that the court is supposed to be a shining example of justice. However, it seems to be the experience of the poet that the court is both corrupt and unjust. Instead of continuing to hold the scales between right and wrong as the last hope for justice, it ironically \"shines like rotten woods\". </p><p>The message for the church is that as the institution of God Almighty its gospel should be the first and the last word in ethics. According to the poet, however, the church is unfortunately failing like other temporal institutions. This is because it is common knowledge that the church \"says what's good and doth no good\". </p><p>The poet's message for temporal authorities is that they are powerless in themselves. The power they wield is in essence, derived from the people who can also take it away from them. They should not lose sight of the fact that they cannot even pretend to carry everybody along as they are only \"strong by a fraction\". For this reason, they can only enjoy the people's love and good will if they are also prepared to give them their all. </p><p>Finally, these messages portray the poet's experience of the pretensions and inadequacies of the \"court\", the \"church\" and the potentates\". As he departs the world, the poets earnestly charges his immortal soul to go out boldly and tell the authorities concerned the whole truth loud and clear and damn the consequence. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Eugene is a prominent businessman, community leader and devout catholic, who governs his family with rigid rules. Eugene does his best to provide all the physical needs of his immediate family and ensures that his children lack nothing.</p><p>However, his wife and children and even his father find it impossible to experience happiness in their interactions with him. He creates in them stress and tension and in his presence, they are ill at ease. The attachment to religion makes him a fanatic whose interpretation of faith is oppressive. When Jaja refuses to take the sacrament during Palm Sunday mass, Eugene is inexplicably furious at the boy and ends up throwing a missal at him. </p><p>Eugene's oppressiveness in his relation with his children makes apparently normal filial interactions painful and torturous. For instance, at tea time, he invites them to take \"love sips\" from his tea cup. An experience such as this which should have been pleasant ironically becomes painful since the \"love sips\" they take are from a scalding cup and they dare not refuse. Eugene's rules for the behaviour of his children are nothing short of regimental. There is a schedule for play, relaxation, work and so on. This makes even playtime unattractive. Anyone who dares to break his schedule is severely punished. </p><p>The kind of punishment which Eugene metes out to his children for real or perceived misdemeanour is inhumane. This involves emotional, psychological and physical abuse. When Karnbili fails to take first position in her school examination, he goes to her school and humiliates her in front of her classmates. He pours boiling water on the feet of the children for sleeping under the same roof as a \"heathen\" who turns out to be their own grandfather, without informing him. As he pours the boiling water on Kambili's feet he is shedding tears. This point to his emotional instability and thus his potential for danger. </p><p>Beatrice his wife dares not intervene. She herself is a victim of domestic violence. She is traumatized and also brutalized. One such outrageous attack by Eugene results in her suffering a miscarriage. The children not only suffer from his brutal acts, their emotions are also battered by the fact that they witness his brutality on their mother. This makes their affection for him turn sour. Their reactions are different. Kambili becomes withdrawn and silent. Jaja however breaks out in rebellion. It is his family's growing antagonism which leads to Eugene's murder. All in all, Eugene's relationship with his family is emotional stressful. His wife and children are traumatized by his religious fanaticism. Rather than a caring husband and father, his behaviour towards his immediate family marks him out as an ogre whose outrageous behaviour leaves them emotionally and psychologically impaired. </p>",

He is also very neat and he was declared the neatest boy in his school during the last academic session. Jaja is strong and courageous. He protects and defends his mother and sister. For instance, when kambili is caught by their father eating when they are supposed to be fasting, he claims that he has made the cornflakes for her so that she can take her medicine for menstrual cramps even though it is their mother who has urged Kambili to eat. He is also rebellious and challenges his father at times; he tells his father he does not feel like going to church because he does not like to take the communion. Knowing how strict Papa is, Jaja exhibits great courage in speaking his mind about the Holy Communion. He is self-willed and assertive. After their visit to Aunty Ifeoma in Nsukka, Jaja feels justified in his self-assertion. He dares to ask his father for the key to his room. The reason of privacy that he gives his father is unthinkable under the constitution of Papa's \"rule\". </p><p>This young man appears to yearn for change.

His sense of responsibility is strong. During the mourning he laments his inability to have taken better care of her mother and the household.

        "answer": "<p>In all, Pokuwaa marries three times. Before her marriage to Kwadwo Fordwuo, she has been married to Kofi Daafo and Kwaku Fosu in that order. Her marriage to Kofi Daafo is childless. This is one marriage that could have been the ideal one. This is because Pokuwaa's closest friend Koramoa is married to Kofi Daafo's friend as well. If they had a child they would make an enviable foursome. </p><p>However, Pokuwaa has to leave her husband under social pressure. Incidentally, her friend Koramoa, though childless, sticks to her husband. In the end Koramoa does have a child; Pokuwaa does not. Childlessness takes Pokuwaa out of her marriage to Kofi Daafo. She lands in marriage with Kwaku Fosu, hoping that, things will be different concerning childbirth. She does not meet with luck, however: childless she remains. Her mother is beside herself with worry over Pokuwaa's childlessness. </p><p>Soon it becomes clear that Pokuwaa's mother is quite determined that the marriage should end if there is going tc be no child. She begins to meddle in the marriage. She, rather than her daughter, finds fault with Kwaku Fosu anc urges her daughter under the least pretext to leave her husband. Eventually for no serious reason for which marriage ought to be broken, Pokuwaa leaves Kwaku Fosu. Thus Pokuwaa enters her first two marriages with ordinary expectations of bearing children and raising them. This expectation never materializes, and she leaves one marriage and then the other. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ASARE KONADU: A Woman In Her Prime </strong></p><p> </p><p>How would you describe the relationship between Kwadwo and Pokuwaa? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Kwadwo and Pokuwaa are the two major characters in the novel. They are husband and wife. Kwadwo and Pokuwaa really love each other. Theirs is a relationship based on mutual love, and the discrimination and male chauvinism which characterizes men's relationship with their female counterparts is noticeably absent. The novel presents a problem-dogged marriage in a positive way. </p><p>The plot of the novel revolves around Pokuwaa's failure to conceive. Normally, one would have expected Kwadwo to have focused attention on his child-bearing wife. Under normal circumstances, Kwadwo given what traditional society has come to accept as. the \"normal\" behaviour of a man to his wife, would have complained endlessly or even proceeded to break up with Pokuwaa. This, however, is not the case. Rather, Kwadwo stands by Pokuwaa in her hour of distress, encouraging her to keep hoping that one day she will be able to bear children. <br>\n </p><p>Kwadwo demonstrates his love for Pokuwaa on many occasions. He is waiting to accompany Pokuwaa to the shrine of Tano after she has chased and recovered her sacrificial hen. He even offers, to her surprise, to spend the whole week with her while she is performing her purification rites. This indicates his dedication to her and his wish to see her living a fulfilled life. He is even prepared to lie to her about his wife's reaction to his intention to spend a whole week with Pokuwaa in order to put her mind at rest. </p><p>When Pokuwaa suffers a miscarriage Kwadwo does not fret as one might have expected. Rather, he comforts her, trying to keep her mind focused on the possibility that she will have another pregnancy. He always keeps at the back of his mind that Pokuwaa's two earlier marriages have been dissolved owing to her failure to bear children. Because of his love for her, he is determined that their marriage will last. He takes good care of Pokuwaa. He tends her farm and helps carry out her daily chores without complaining. Kwadwo's love for Pokuwaa is reciprocated. She wishes to spend all her time with him. She wants to bear a child to make both of them happy. She appreciates his every effort and through all her pain allows herself to be consoled by Kwadwo. In the end, their love sees them through their days of anguish. Pokuwaa is able to conceive and husband and wife look forward to a life of fulfilled hopes and dreams. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The boy, mandolin is presented in a favourable light. Despite his age, he maintains an almost mature relationship with the old man. He is loyal, caring (even doting), thoughtful and trusting. </p><p>We first meet the boy with the old man, who has been fishing without any luck for 84 days. There is a strong bond between the two. The boy reveals his confidence in the old man by calling him by the name of his heydays: Santiago. Because of this intimacy, he is on first-name terms with the old man. Even when he is separated from the old man. And now in another boat the boy does not let go his solidarity with the old man. When we see him and the old man, the boy suggests that he and the old man move back and work together again as they have made some money at the new place. The old man declines. At this early point, he renews his faith in the old man, castigating his own father for not having faith. They boy cares for the old man as an older person will have done. He is even doting. He takes the old man to the Terrace, buy him beer, and humours him by reliving the memories of their fishing together. He promises to get the old man some baits and entice his master to go 'for out', solely to keep an eye on the old man. </p><p>He urges the old man to stay warm. When the old man will not eat the supper that he has provided, the boy gets quite stern, like a loving mother-he will not permit the old man's going fishing on an empty stomach 'while I'm alive'. He chides himself for being thoughtless and resolves to get the old man a shirt, a jacket, some shoes and another blanket for the winter. He is a source of reassurance for the old man. For him, of all the good and great fisherman, there is only the old man. On the lucky day, they drink coffee together, the boy gets the sardines and the two baits and walks the old man to his skiff and wishes him luck. </p><p>Even the fishermen acknowledge his role in the old man's survival. His concern for Santiago and about his welfare is not fake. When he is with old man, they are true companions. He prevents the old man's drift towards despondency and tells him how he has been searched for, assuring him that he is a winner-the fish did not beat him. They make plans for the future. As manolin leaves Santiago, he admonishes him to get well fast for the days ahead. He draws our pity by his tears of unique fellow-feeling. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: The Old Man and The Sea </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the theme of perseverance in the novel</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The whole novel appears to be centered on the theme of perseverance. In their own ways both Santiago and his friend Manolin are subjects of perseverance. His very existence without a wife, the support of older friends and wealth, would have been a very good reason for Santiago to give up living. Even when his friend is taken away from him by his parents, he perseveres.</p><p>Manolin also perseveres in his friendship with Santiago despite the prevailing situations. As a poor man, Santiago barely has enough to eat. He does not throw in the towel but keeps his hope alive by fantasizing pots of yellow rice and fish. His fantasy is a source of perseverance for Santiago. Pushed by it, he is able to carry on with his trade virtually on an empty stomach. When the novel opens the old man has been at sea for over two months without any catch. The natural thing to do would have been to come back home, yet he stays at it. His hope is kept alive by the fact that previously; he had gone \"eighty seven days without fish\" after which he caught big ones daily for three weeks. When he hooks on to a massive fish which he has to pull in all by himself, he demonstrates his perseverance by hanging on even though badly bruised and battered.</p><p>The boy perseveres in his friendship with Santiago. He is detached from Santiago to join other fishermen who are well-to-do. This new situation would have been good reason to abandon Santiago, but he keeps on being his friend. The old man spends a considerable number of days at sea chasing the illusive catch. Meantime, the boy keeps a constant check on him through visits to his shack. The boy's perseverance pays off when Santiago finally does return. Unaided, Santiago has fought and killed sharks that have eaten his fish. The two friends finally reinforce each other despite the quality of the old man's catch. They show that perseverence can be rewarding. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The novel is an adventure story. It is the account of the experiences of some English boys on an uninhabited island. They are marooned on the island through a plane crash. The boys are excited when they first appear on the island. In their innocence, they are enchanted with the prospect of having \"fun and games\". All by themselves, the boys are far way from the prying eyes of adults who would have their movement controlled. They glamour of this affects the boys. They organized themselves under a leader who is Ralph. They form a hunting group headed by Jack. For their own rescue and security they attempt to keep a fire going. As the sole occupants, they assume that the island belongs to them,. They explore their new surrounding, have fun and play at being hunters. </p><p>Soon, however, their game degenerates dangerously. Simon is mistaken for an imaginary beast of which they are all afraid and he is killed. This follows the killing of a pig by the hunters. They impale the head of the pig on a stake as sacrifice for the beast. Not long after this, the accidental killing of Simon matures into deliberate murder of piggy who has lost his spectacles. The game of hunters continues and becomes quite deadly. By the use of the conch, a semblance of authoritative behaviour is put in place. Without the conch one had no authority to speak to the group. This search for order does not last. The animal in the boys surfaces with the conflict between Jack and Ralph heightening. Things nearly get out of hand. Ralph becomes the underdog and is chased by the others led by jack. He turns for dear life but it is clear that he cannot escape a cruel end. </p><p>The first experiment in which a stone is thrown soon leads to willful destruction of life by the boys. But for the arrival of the naval officer, the paradise atmosphere portrayed at the beginning will have become more tragic than the boys have expected. The boys' adventure ends with the arrival of adults from the Navy. The arrival of the sailors is Ralph's salvation. It is also the means by which all the savaged comes to an end and the boys return to civilization. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>WILLIAM GOLDING: Lord of the Flies </strong></p><p> </p><p>How does Ralph's exercise of authority differ from Jack's? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>By their nature, Ralph and Jack are opposites. Their notions of authority are dissimilar and their exercise of power differs remarkably. The boys have voted Ralph as their chief. He thinks there has to be order as well as rules. These rules must be obeyed by all without exception. Initially it has seemed that Jack is of the same mind. Yet Ralph has discerned from Jack's voice that jack is one who has his own mind. </p><p>While Ralph takes the election result calmly, Jack is mortified. Jack expects to be the chief by right. He is a choir leader and can sing. So while Ralph keeps all aloof awaiting the decision of the others in the matter, Jack actually asserts his eligibility. Ralph's notion is that power is sharing. As soon as he is elected, he thinks of offering Jack a position. He gives Jack leadership of the choir and the freedom to call them an army of hunters as he chooses. Jack's taking charge, on the other hand, gives him absolute power over the hunters. </p><p>Another difference in their exercise of authority is that while Ralph places absolute trust in the conch which represents order, Jack only makes use of the conch, at his convenience. Whereas Ralph consults the others in taking decisions, Jack's word is law. In exercising authority, Ralph acknowledges that Piggy is wise and comes to rely on Piggy's wisdom. Jack on the other hand, orders his hunters to do things. When he wants to make fire, after the separation, he organizes a night raid of Ralph's headquarters and steals Piggy's spectacles. Ralph says he would have given Jack the fire if he had asked. But Jack is not one to request fire from anyone, especially when he is chief in his own right. To sum it up, Ralph believes in consultation and dialogue in the exercise of authority while Jack is authoritarian and dictatorial. </p>",
