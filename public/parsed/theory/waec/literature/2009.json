        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>ATHOL FUGARD: Sizwe Bansi is Dead. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine the significance of Sizwe's \"death\".</p>",
        "answer": "<p> Life for black people in South Africa is cheerless. The people are oppressed and they lack prospects for a good ife. As far as work goes, they can have only the menial jobs. By law, black people must carry passbooks without which they cannot get work, or move about without getting into trouble with the authorities.</p><p>This is the society in which Sizwe finds himself when he arrives in Port Elizabeth without valid papers. Therefore, his stay there is considered illegal, even though he is a native of the land. His discovery in Zola's place leads to his finding refuge in Buntu's place.</p><p>While returning with Buntu from an evening out, he encountered a dead man on a rubbish dump. This leads to his so-called \"death\". Buntu comes up with the idea that Sizwe swap identities with the dead man. He even explains that the dead man would have approved Sizwe's adoption of his identity. With the replacing of the dead man's picture in his passbook with Sizwe's, Sizwe Bansi becomes Robert Zwelinzima. The best thing that happens in the life of Sizwe is this \"death\".</p><p>The immediate significance of this \"death\" is that it enables Sizwe, alias Robert, to avoid imminent repatriation to King Williams's town. Thus he can now live in Port Elizabeth by right and by preference. His \"death\" also entitles him to work and to have some marginal dignity in the society. It is ironical that it requires Sizwe's \"death\" in the manner it occurs for him to survive in his own country. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>ATHOL FUGARD: Sizwe Bansi is Dead. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Give an account of the preparations for Ford's visit to the Assembly Plant. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The preparation for the visit of Henry Ford to the Assembly Plant exposes the evils of racial discrimination and particularly the oppressive nature of the apartheid system of government in South Africa. Mr. Henry Ford is to visit the plant in order to commission the expansion of the car plant. Baas Bradley is the foreman. He does all within his power to see to it that the preparations for the visit of the plant proprietor does not fail.</p><p>First, there is a notice for all the workers informing them of Fords's visit and the preparations to be made. The next thing is Baas Bradley's instruction that there be a general cleaning. Styles recalls that during the general cleaning, -iot water with brushes and electric mops are used to wash the floors first, then the thick oil and dirt under the machines are washed. In no time the place is spotless \"like you would have thought it had just been built\".</p><p>The second stage of the preparation involves the painting and marking of safety precautions. This Styles says has not been done for the past five years. These safety precautions are marked in different colours of paint and translated into the native language of the black workers.</p><p>At the end of all the washing and painting, the workers are directed to have a hot shower so that they can look Jean and fresh. To do this, they are given soap and a towel each. The workers are clean to the point that they feel very embarrassed for being fresh because they are not used to it.</p><p>The next step in the preparation is the supply of new working tools to the workers. Styles observes that his tools needed replacement a year earlier but have not been replaced until now. New overalls are equally given to the workers to make them look as if they are always using new tools and overalls. Brand new fire proof aprons are also given :a them.</p><p>Armed with all these necessary tools, the workers are to get back to work, sing and pretend that they are sappy to be part of Mr. Ford's plant.</p><p>Styles is asked by Mr. Baas Bradley to translate these instructions to his fellow black workers. He mimicks Baas Bradley in a satirical manner and this adds to the humour of the play. Again, this further exposes the hypocrisy of the whites in South Africa. Through the translation too, the workers are told that the light will be slowed so that they can ,work and sing when Mr. Ford arrives. However, when the august visitor arrives, he does not even look at the plant nor the workers. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Mr. James Ofosu is the central character in the play. He is a rich transport service owner who makes fortunes for it. The action of the play begins and ends in his house. </p><p>He is the source of conflict and tension in the play, though he means well by seeking prestigious professions for his children (law and engineering). He is too temperamental and does not listen to opposing views. This affects his relationship with members of his household, particularly Maanan, Aaron and Hannah. Unfortunately for him, the only one he trusts (Lawyer Bonu) betrays him where it hurts most - seducing his only daughter.</p><p>He reveals a general nature, especially in his relationship with Lawyer Bonu, his so called trusted friend, and his sister Fosuwa, but he is also capable of swift and dramatic action where he is faced with the truth or the reality of things. For example, he orders Bonu out of his house when he discovers that Bonu is unfaithful. He also allows the children to pursue their chosen careers. Perhaps it is his little education that allows Lawyer Bonu to exploit him.</p><p>To sum up, James Ofosu matures in the play into a person who is more accommodating of other views and more likely to be cautious in making friends. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>In the play, a father, James Ofosu, is terribly let down by his own friend who is shamelessly pursuing the former's daughter. Mr. Ofosu, who has little education, wants to see his children established in prestigious careers. His eldest son is a medical doctor, and the second is training to be a chartered Accountant. He wants his third son, Aaron, to be a mechanical engineer and the youngest child, Maanan, a girl, to be a lawyer.</p><p>The girl wants to take up dancing as a career. The father's opposition to dancing frustrates Maanan. Mr. Ofosu discusses the situation with his friend Lawyer Bonu who, for his own selfish reason, encourages Mr, Ofosu to insist on Maanan becoming a lawyer. Mr. Ofosu has great faith and trust in his friend, and accordingly forces Maanan to work in Bonu's office as preparatory towards becoming a lawyer. Lawyer Bonu takes advantage of his friend's trust in him to make advances to Maanan, knowing that Mr. Ofosu will not believe whatever Maanan says. The sexual harassment continues. When Mr. Ofosu hears of it, he refuses to believe it and accuses his family of plotting against his friend. Finally, Lawyer Bonu is caught in the act while on a visit to the Ofosu home. This is betrayal of friendship at its worst. Naturally, Ofosu feels terribly let down by his friend. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Deception pervades the play. From the first scene to the last, one character or the other is deceived by or deceives another. By this deception, humour and suspense are sustained. Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky are informed by Vlass that a certain guest, a young man whom the two have noticed, is from Petersburg. He has been lodging at the inn for two weeks and appears to be in no hurry to leave while eating on credit. Having had wind of a letter warning the Mayor of the imminent arrival of an official who is coming from Petersburg incognito to inspect the whole province', they wrongly conclude that he is the expected official.</p><p>Convinced of their discovery, Bob and Dob hurry to the Mayor, disrupt the meeting at which the very matter of the visit is being discussed, and deliver the deceptive news that the personage is already in town. There is humorous panic among the deceived Mayor and the local authority officials. The Mayor, taken in by the news, decides to meet the supposed visiting official, tacitly acknowledging his own corrupt dealings. The deception is reinforced as the Mayor strives to bribe Hlestakov. The other local officials follow suit. The merchants take their place in the queue to offer inducements to Hlestakov to take up their grievances against the Mayor. Hlestakov himself is full of deception. Seeing that he has been mistaken for a more important personage than he is, he reinforces the deception by extorting bribes as loans that he obviously does not intend to repay.</p><p>Hlestakov worms his way into the affection of Anna, who, being deceived, persuades her husband to give his blessing to a union between their daughter and Hlestakov. The deception is humorous and keeps the plot moving through its suspense.</p><p>The announcement of the engagement of Marya to the imposter causes great excitement. Everyone congratulates the Mayor and his family on their good fortune, even envying them their luck. The people are deceived as the merchants recant and withdraw their complaints against the Mayor.</p><p>Yosif also play an important role in the deception that occurs in the play. He realizes their being mistaken for prominent people and plays his part well in the deception. Just before the arrival of the real Government Inspector, it is Yosif who impresses upon his master that it is time to run. Apart from these, there are various incidents of deception in the play, such as officials putting their house in order for the benefit of the supposed inspector, and mother and daughter vying for Hlestakov's affection.</p><p>The scales fall from the eyes of the town officials with the receipt of a letter from Hlestakov, insulting all of them. The arrival of his Excellency the Inspector-General, himself, appointed by Imperial decree, reveals the true identity of Hlestakov as an imposter. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Hlestakov and the Mayor are two major characters in the play. They exhibit weaknesses which contribute to the development of the plot</p><p>Both of them are public servants. While Hlestakov is a junior officer in Peterburg, the Mayor is the political and administrative head of one of the districts in Russia.</p><p>While the Mayor seems to have risen to the pinnacle of his profession, Hlestakov is stuck in the mud, prompting his father to invite him for questioning in Saratov.</p><p>Both of them are corrupt and exploitative. The Mayor takes advantage of his position to embezzle public funds and extort money from the traders and merchants. He violates the rights of the commoners in conscripting the locksmith flogging the sergeant's wife. Hlestakov equally takes advantage of the general ignorance of his true identity to extort reasonable sums of money from whoever comes his way.</p><p>Hiestakov is a bachelor with no visible family responsibility. His reckless and extravagant life style leads to Denury on his journey to Saratov. The Mayor, on the other hand, is a family man. He collects bribes to augment the -ante he receives and holds his family together. -Hestakov is a dupe in the game of deception while the Mayor is duped.</p><p>Hlestakov has the good fortune of being able to escape with his loot while the unfortunate Mayor has no —cans of escape and must face the genuine inspector General. - point worth noticing is that the Mayor has no illusions about the run-down affairs of the province.

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>ROBERT BOLT: A Man For All Seasons </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the notion that Sir Thomas More is naive</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Sir Thomas More is the central character in the play, In his dealings with the people around him and with very serious matters of state, More does seem naive. More fails to see greed in Richard Rich who is not employed but refuses More's offer to teach, preferring something big and more lucrative to teaching. He does dismiss Roper's exposition that Rich is dangerous.</p><p>More does not see the danger, nor the threat, in his refusal to approve of King Henry's divorce with Catherine. Even when the King visits More personally, More is too naive to understand the threat in the King's refusal to even eat :he food offered him by More's wife. Even when More's wife advises him to sign the divorce papers for the sake of his family, More is still adamant. Naturally, the king is angry and will seek his revenge but again, More does not care. He s only mindful about what his conscience tells him.</p><p>More demonstrates naivety in his discussion with Wolsey. He fails to see the danger if Wolsey fails; neither does he bother to discuss the matter with his wife. In the alliance between Rich and Crownwell lies a threat to More, out he does not see any evil there. He fails to see that these two are looking for means to destroy him.</p><p>Thomas More also puts much trust in the law to vindicate him. What he overlooks, however, is that the law can easily De manipulated by greedy men like Crownwell. More behaves naively in his refusal to pay heed to Rich's warning about Crownwell collecting information about him and equally persistently refuses to listen to his wife's and daughter's advice. Even when they visit him in jail, instead of discussing his plight, he is busy admiring his wife's dress. His wife is exasperated. She becomes irritated that his case is serious but he does not see it that way. In fact, he appears unconcerned about what may befall him.</p><p>At the trial, one is expecting More to clarify issues in his defence but he is evasive and does not seem to be bothered at all. He carries his theory about conscience to provocative lengths. This is what Crownwell capitalizes on. Even More's speech is considered ill timed. This further gives Crownwell and others the opportunity to condemn him. In the end, he is sentenced and executed.</p><p>On the other hand, a candidate who disagrees that More is naïve and advances strong arguments to support his/her assertion should be rewarded. Such a candidate might mention that what we see as More's naivety might be attributed to his virtuous nature. He is a just man and believes in the goodness of human nature. His trust in Richard Rich, for example, could be attributed to this. Also his own conscience allied to his faith in the law assures him that he is standing for what is right and just.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Richard Rich is a law graduate of Cambridge, a learned fellow and a friend' of Thomas More. While he is unemployed, More suggests that he takes up a teaching appointment, a proposal which he declines.</p><p>His desire and ambition to get rich quickly make him dishonest, disloyal and ultimately a traitor to Thomas More. He allows himself to be used by Crownwell to entrap More. He contributes immensely to the eventual execution of Thomas More which climaxes the plot of the play. Rich's closeness to More puts him in a unique position to serve as a principal witness against More in his trial. More gives him the gift of a silver cup offered to him by a female litigant and it is this cup which Rich makes available to Crownwell as a damaging exhibit in the trial of More.</p><p>In a sense, Richard Rich serves as a foil to More's character and this contributes to the development of the plot. The contrast in their characters is crucial to the plot. Whereas More believes that integrity is constant, Rich holds the opinion that 'Everyman has his price'. More's all-trusting nature which leads to his taking Rich into his complete confidence sets the stage for Rich's subsequent betrayal of his 'friend'.</p><p>Richard Rich is, therefore, very important to the development of the plot. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>Illustrate Senghor's use of figures of speech in <strong>I will Pronounce Your Name</strong></p>",
        "answer": "<p>Senghor makes abundant use of figures of speech in this poem. In fact, the power of the poem rests on the effective use of figures of speech and almost every line owes its meaning to one figure of speech or the other. It is these that the poet uses to express his deep love for his mistress, Naett, symbolizing the black woman and by extension the African continent. The opening lines contain similes and metaphors powerfully expressed. Naett's name is \"mild like cinnamon\".</p><p>This simile creates the central image of Naett's sensuousness which runs through the poem. The metaphor which follows moves from the image of taste to that of smell: \"the fragrance in which the lemon grove sleeps\". The overall impression here is one of beauty and sensuousness. Other figures of speech enhance this impression of beauty and sensuousness. There is the metaphor of the \"booming coffee trees\", for example. However, one senses that Senghor is not only concerned with creating an image of beauty and sensuousness alone. Naett's resilience is also in focus.</p><p>In an effective simile, he compares her to \"the Savannah that blossoms forth under the masculine ardour of the midday sun\". This not only demonstrates Naett's beauty and sensuousness but also her ability to thrive under the most adverse conditions.</p><p>From this point on, Naett becomes a symbol of both beauty and strength. She is compared to the violent tornado in the metaphor, \"Naett, that is the dry tornado\" and to lightning in the metaphor which follows: the hard clap of lightning. She emerges here as both an object of terrifying beauty and also a symbol of great strength.</p><p>The metaphor in \"Naett coin of gold\" and the oxymoron in \"shining coal\" express the fact that her beauty is hard to define. In these two figures of speech are encapsulated the thoughts which Senghor has been expressing all along. that is, Naett is black, sensuous and radiant.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>The dance symbolizes the poet's yearning to be identified with his roots. He regrets his inability to take part in this particular cultural dance as he has been, in his own words \"early sequestered from my tribe\".</p><p>The poet is fascinated with this aspect of his culture which engages the dancer in an act \"intervolving earth, sky and flesh\". This is expressed in his powerful description of the dancer as she wriggles her body in complete abandon. He describes the dance as a \"magic maze\" of music with its \"intricate pattern rippling crest after crest\".</p><p>The dancer contrasts sharply with the poet as the dance signifies her deep knowledge of, and involvement in, her culture. The poet's cultural alienation manifests itself in his inability to participate in such an infectious dance. His level of involvement is restricted only to admiration. He could feel the \"communal call\" but is unable to respond to it. Thus we see his frustration conveyed at the end of the poem, when he could only wish to be part of the dance. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>\"The Solitary Reaper\" is a poem that gives expression to the overwhelming influence that nature exercises on a romantic poet, especially William Wordsworth.</p><p>As the poet listens to the \"plaintive numbers\" he appears mesmerized. Nature, to Wordsworth, is more than natural scenes like forest, rivers and others. It includes songs coming from nature, common people, rural life and indeed anything that can be identified with nature.</p><p>In the poem, the valley is said to be overflowing with the song. Indeed, the song and the valley are fused together and both exercise a profound influence on the speaker. The influence is such that long after he leaves the scene he still carries the song in his heart.</p><p>The idea of the nightingale being able to sing \"welcome notes\" to \"weary bands of travelers\" or the 'cuckoo bird' singing \"to break the silence of the seas\" also shows the power of nature on man.</p><p>It needs to be noticed that the song's influence on the man is everlasting.

        "answer": "<p>Marvell employs several images to express his love to his mistress and his overwhelming desire to consummate their love. His use of the pair of allusions - the \"Indian Ganges\", and the \"Tide of Humber\" - sets the tone. In reference to these images, Marvell asserts that not even the geographical distance that may come between them can dampen his love for his mistress. These images are appropriately followed by the metaphor of \"my vegetable love\" which \"will grow vaster than empires\". What Marvell suggests here is that his love, like a plant, has the faculty of growth that does not diminish.</p><p>Other images then follow involving hyperbolical references to the number of years it will take him to adore the various parts of his mistress's body.</p><p>But as the poem continues, Marvell abandons the earlier images and brings in the notion that his love for his mistress is bound by time. Thus we have images of the \"winged chariots\", \"deserts of vast eternity\" which suggest the ravages of time which both lovers cannot escape. Indeed, the image of \"the grave's a fine and private place / But none I think do there embrace\" heightens the catastrophe which awaits the lovers if they do not embrace.</p><p>As the poem ends, fresh images are introduced. These involve \"fire\", \"predatory birds\" and \"rough strife\", suggesting that there is no time but now to consummate their love and have control over their fate rather than succumb to it. This is perfectly captured in the image of the sun which the lovers \"will make....run\". </p>",

He declares that \"the war has brought everybody low\" including himself.</p><p>Toje even before the war was well respected among his friends and others. A rubber magnate of great repute, he has contributed immensely to the rubber industry. He argues that he could have, but for the outbreak of the war, attained great heights. The war has affected his rubber business. The violence of the war makes working in the rubber plantation risky. In his view therefore his prosperity as a businessman has been severely affected by the war.</p><p>Again, the war undermines Toje's authority at home. He feels he no longer commands the respect of his wife which he did before the war. The impact of the war on Toje is not altogether negative, however. As the town's most prominent citizen he maintains that anybody who comes to the town to do business of any sort must be on good terms With him. Even the military are not exempted from this. That is why he is able to persuade Major Bello Akuya to put Oshevire into detention on false charges of collaborating with the enemy.</p><p>The war provides Toje with the opportunity to make a lot of money in spite of his many protestations as to its negative effects. He uses his influence to secure the contract to supply the troops in Urukpe with food. Also it is money which he uses to attract Aku who has been reduced to penury by her husband's detention.</p><p>The effect of the war is therefore both positive and negative on Toje. </p>",

This situation builds up in Agbadi pent-up passion for, and vengefulness towards Ona. These show in the passionate love-making that results in the conception of Nnu-Ego. By not sharing Aghadi's compound and withholding herself from her man as she thinks fit, Ona teases Agbadi to distraction. This reveals the resilient spirit of womanhood that is so severely restricted in a male-dominated society. Agbadi may subdue an elephant but he is hard put to crushing Ona's stubbornness and self-willed spirit.</p><p>In a society like hers, Ona's will must follow her father's whims. Her desires are trapped in the dream will of her father to have a male child merely because her father does not have a son. Agbadi's remark that it is not Ona's fault that Obi Umunna does not father a son is not only a personal protest and a defence of Ona, but also an indictment of the norms of a society that permits a thing like that. The relationship also presents Ona as a foil to her own daughter. Ona's assertiveness contrasts sharply with Nnu Ego's submissiveness and long suffering nature.</p><p>The relationship underscores the futility of a woman's efforts to hold her own in society. Try as Ona does to bluff and torment Agbadi, she is brought to her knees finally by the man. Even though Ona appears to be in control in the decision as to the ownership of her unborn child, her child is still not hers to own; it must belong to one or the other of the two men, depending on the child's sex. The Ona-Agbadi relationship reveals the assigned places of men and women in the society: the man leads and rules the woman, who must be subservient. Emecheta however, expresses her opposition to the status quo in the Ona-Agba relationship. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Obi Umunna is an important chief. He is wealthy and very traditional. He has no male child and so lacks natural heir. This is a harsh reality that he must tackle. Luckily the system of inheritance provides an outlet for him - daughter, Ona. He applies the rules rigidly.</p><p>Ona is Obi Umunna's daughter. She is of rare beauty and also of unparalleled strong will, brought up to love ar adore her father. She is in love with Agbadi but cannot marry him. She can only remain his lover (mistress) by a decree of her father. Ona, despite her strength of character and firm ego is ruled by her father's decisions in the one crucial pa of her life - marriage. She cannot marry the man of her desire. As the permitted mistress of her lover, she may bee children by him, but any male child should belong to her father.</p><p>This arrangement is exasperating for Agbadi. He does complain bitterly and rebukes Obi Umunna, saying the his inability to produce an heir himself is not the making of his daughter, Ona. In a sense, one may say that Agbadi confrontation with Obi Umunna over the issue is an indictment of a system that deprives people of their offspring mere! because others are unable to have their own children.</p><p>When Ona becomes pregnant, she reduces the pressure from Agbadi over the decree and settles the matter b resolving that if she has a daughter it will belong to Agbadi. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>RICHARD WRIGHT: Black Boy </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine the role of Richard's mother in the novel</p><p> </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Richard's mother, Ella Wilson Wright, plays a prominent role in the novel. She is quite a strong woman who, right from the beginning of her marriage has to struggle in order to keep afloat in facing the challenges of bringing up the children and that of marital life. She has the unfortunate experience of being abandoned by Richard's father which has ar adverse effect on the children especially Richard. This arouses in Ella the need to stand up to the task of bringing up the children, failure of which may predispose them to a life of doom.</p><p>She is a wonderful mother to the children but is a disciplinarian at the same time. Ella makes Richard to bury the kitten, which he spitefully kills, in order to teach him a lesson. She makes him to know that it is not good to kill.</p><p>Ella also teaches Richard to be brave and face the odds of life no matter what the circumstances. An example of this is found in the encounter between Richard and the members of the gang who waylay him on his way to the grocery store when he is six years old. Twice the boys beat Richard up and rob him of his money. On the third time however, his mother slaps him, gives him more money with a stern warning that he should not come home empty-handed. This boosts Richard's courage and in the third encounter, he succeeds in beating the boys, making them tc flee home to their parents.</p><p>This early training inculcates in Richard the need for self defence and survival. This helps Richard later in life -because he always has to fight in order to assert himself. A good mother, she forces Richard, in spite of his lack of belief in Christianity to attend a revival service. Though confused, Richard, knowing that his mother truly loves him, does not want to disappoint her. According to him, \"If refuse, it means that I do not love my mother\". At last, he joins the baptismal class.</p><p>Ella represents in the novel the entire Negro womenfolk who have to face the task of fending for their children, and to a large extent expresses the biased nature of the laws of the society. This is why after Ella falls sick, Richard has to take up the responsibility of feeding the family. Ella labours se much to send the children to school within the limits of her financial income. Again, Elia serves as a role model to women who, in spite of the fact that they are saddled with the responsibility of carrying out these enormous tasks, refuse to trade away their dignity and flirt around with the menfolk.</p><p>Through her, a profound statement is made on the injustice in a society that treats womanhood with contempt and subjects them to constant harassment, intimidation and oppression. All in all, Ella Wright is a very caring and loving mother who plays a prominent role in the novel. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Richard, the protagonist of the novel is portrayed as a self-determined character. Right from childhood we see Richard's self-determined nature. He sets their house ablaze out of curiosity. He deliberately takes his father's instruction to kill the cat at face value to spite him. The punishment he receives on this incident makes him more hardened and he it resolves not to take instructions from his father. This incident further heightens Richard's hatred for him.</p><p>Richard refuses to allow even the closest members of his family to intimidate him. His resistance to Aunt Addie's bullying and his grandfather's attempt to indoctrinate him into the Seventh-Day-Adventist sect are pointers tc his strength of character.</p><p>Richard's characteristic as a self determined person is demonstrated in his reaction to white oppression. He would not sell his dog to the white woman in spite of his situation. He resolves to stop selling the newspaper used by the whites to propagate their cause despite the fact that he needs the wages. He does not hesitate to abandon his job where he faces white oppression.</p><p>A further indication of Richard's characteristic as a self determined person is found in his refusal to be intimidated by the Principal of his school to read a valedictory speech which contains some ideas that negate his life principles as a black person.</p><p>His encounter with Mrs. Moss shows him as a man who strives to achieve any goals he sets for himself despite all distractions. </p><p>His literary contribution in the Hell's Half Acre despite threats from authorities and his immediate family show as a self determined young man.</p><p>He never relents in the pursuit of his (objectives) to emancipate the black man from oppression by the whites. more he faces challenges from discrimination the more he becomes determined to fight back. In this way he is able to face even the darkest of his life's experiences as a black boy. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>GEORGE ELIOT: Silas Marner </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine the role of money and gold in the life of Silas in the novel.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Gold plays a very important role in the development of Silas Marner's personality. Gold, in the novel, may be understood as a general term for money, The terms may therefore be used interchangeably. The theft of the bag of money by William Dane at the death of the deacon provides Dane the opportunity to break up t'e engagement between Silas and Sarah.</p><p>The theft also leads to the casting of lots. The lots declare Silas as the culprit. This leads Marner to leave Lantern Yard and settle at Raveloe. His heart is full of bitterness and his faith in man and God shattered.</p><p>At Raveloe, he puts all his strength and mind into his weaving, and gold (money) starts trickling in. The gold accumulates and becomes his passion. He now finds a new companion in his gold. This contributes to his further alienation from the society. Henceforth, his only contact with the society is reduced to buying the few necessities he needs for his weaving and food. He thus becomes a complete hermit with his gold providing the only companionship he needs. He then becomes more mechanical and less human. This continues until he loses his gold.</p><p>The loss of his gold now provides the first occasion for him to really interact with people. Many of the superstitions people attach to him disappear. He begins to attract the sympathy of others. -The process of his re-integration into the society comes with the coming of Eppie who, in the mind of Silas Marner, has mme to replace his gold. In fact the lost gold provides the strongest motive for keeping Eppie.</p><p>It is significant to note that Eppie has yellow or golden hair and Marner takes her to be his gold that has returned. In Eppie, Marner now has a companion.</p><p>When eighteen years later the gold is rediscovered, it now has a better use. It seems as if the gold goes away and comes back when Marner has better use for it. The gold, from this perspective, takes on a mysterious outlook in conformity with Marner's own mysterious life as it often does in fairy tales.</p><p>It can therefore be said that gold has multiple roles in the novel. It serves as an instrument of Marner's separation tom the society and of his re-integration into the society. It also provides an atmosphere of mystery. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>GEORGE ELIOT: Silas Marner </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine how William Dane affects the fortunes of Silas Marner</p>",
        "answer": "<p>William Dane affects the life and fortunes of Silas Marner to a large extent. Silas is highly regarded in the church assembly in Lantern Yard where he worships with his best friend, William Dane.</p><p>Silas is known to be a young man of exemplary life and ardent faith. Silas loves William Dane but it soon becomes apparent that he does not love him return. When Silas has a 'cataleptic lit' and everybody sees it as a 'divine visitation' it is William alone who sees it as a visitation from the devil. Silas is hurt by his friend's uncomplimentary interpretation and derogatory remarks. He is discouraged by his friend's doubts as he believes that William is the one person who should know him better than everyone else. Silas' trust in William manifests itself in his invitation to join him and Sarah on their Sunday afternoon outings.</p><p>During this period, Silas notices a certain coldness in Sarah's behaviour to him. Silas' trusting nature is soon to suffer a sudden jolt when he and William Dane take turns in watching over the sick Deacon. William fails to turn up on a night he is to relieve Silas and in the morning, the Deacon is found dead and the church money missing. Responsibility for the theft is attributed to Silas but it soon becomes clear that William is responsible. He has deliberately framed Silas to get rid of him. Silas' realization of William's evil has a devastating effect on him. When he realizes that William has taken over his betrothed, Sarah, he loses complete faith in the goodness of human beings.</p><p>This betrayal affects him for the rest of his life. William's treachery also contributes to Silas' loss of faith in God. The lots which Silas hopes will clear him of the charges levied against him declare him guilty. </p>",
