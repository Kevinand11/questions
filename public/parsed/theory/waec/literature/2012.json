        "answer": "<p>In spite of his sound knowledge of the English legal system, Barrister Onyimdze's love for, and practice of African ways of life, remain untainted and enviable. These qualities in him are shown on many occasions.</p><p>One such occasion is when he bluntly refuses to marry a European lady when advised to do so by Mrs. Borofosem. This, according to him is most undesirable for Africans. The lawyer also employs Okadu as his clerk and manages to teach him to appreciate African values.</p><p>His preference for African cloths, especially when he is not at work is remarkable; so is his love for African food and drinks such as `ahe' — a popular drink even among the fishermen's wives. In all these, he readily identifies with the common people, including their music and dance. His love for and defence of African values are eloquently expressed in his brilliant argument in favour of African traditional marriage when he takes the ill-fated Okadu-Tsiba marriage up. He acts as a foil to Mrs. Borofosem. It is his steadfast defence of African values which finally turns characters like Mrs. Borofosem around. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Members of this \"elite\" group are a bunch of Africans struggling between two cultures, neither of which they are appreciably integrated into. The club is a motley assemblage of semi-literates and university graduates who choose to adopt, hook, line and sinker, a number of English ways of life at the expense of their own authentic cultural values. The speech delivered by their secretary during the ill-conceived Okadu-Tsiba wedding ceremony sums up all that is ludicrous in their comportment.</p><p>The speech urges those aspiring to be gentlemen to abhor all that is African: food, drinks and the use of the mother tongue, a mention a few. To them, the ostentatious use of high falutin words and heavily loaded expressions shows a mastery of the English language. Thus Mr. Nku's speech is ludicrously laced with such jaw-breaking words as \"Iachrimosity\" instead of \"tears\", \"celibacy\" instead of \"bachelor\" and \"hymeneal altar\" instead of 'wedding'.</p><p>The expression \"black skin white masks\" fittingly captures the comportment of the cosmopolitan club members. The sharp contradictions in their blindly adopted ways of life expose their ludicrous position between the two cultures. </p>",

As herald of the allied forces, he is a symbol of loyalty and remains faithful to his master from the beginning to the end. According to Erelu, Gesinde is a messenger of doom; anytime he appears among the women, they expect the worst.

Gesinde claims that he is only a messenger and therefore not responsible for whatever action is taken on the women: \"I am only a messenger, just a borrowed mouth\".</p><p>He sheds tears at the sight of Adumaadan's paying her last respect to her slain son.

        "answer": "<p>The Allied Forces have sacked the city of Owu, and the ancestral deity, Anlugbua, looks upon the destruction, dejected. He is met by his mother — Lawumi. From their conversation, it seems that the war is the result of the intervention of the gods in the affairs of men even though the contribution of mortals cannot be ignored. It is Lawumi's decree that Owu should be punished through its sacking by the Allied Forces for Owu's arrogance towards the ancestral home, ile-Ife. Like the Owu people, the Allied Forces desecrate the holy places and set fire to the shrine of Lawumi. For this they must be made to pay.</p><p>Lawumi is particularly angry because the Allied Forces have not only killed her worshippers but also chased Owu people running to her shrine for refuge and massacred them there. They have even captured the princess Orisaye, who is the vestal votary of Obatala. Lawumi's anger finds satisfaction in the help she expects from other deitieswho will confound the return journey of the Allied Forces. She avers that the gods are not the plaything of mortals. It seems certain that, being angry because his shrine has not been spared, Ogun, the god of war, will enter the fray. Anlugbua agrees to join.</p><p>The agreement that mother and son makes suggests that mortals are mere pawns in the game of chess that the gods play. At every stage of the conflict, it seems that the gods are the initiators of the animosity that leads to renewed aggression in the fight between mortal and his fellow mortal.</p><p>The gods seem interested in the daily conduct of mortals; they will cause mortals to fight other mortals to punish their erring colleagues. However, these gods do not control the temper of the warriors or the tempo of the war. In the end, the favourite side in the reprisal game exceeds the mandate to punish and the extent of punishment. Then it must pay for its excesses. The gods are whimsical and capricious. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The differences between Louka and Raina are both social and behavioural. On the one had, Raina belongs to the upper class as a daughter of aristocrats. On the other hand, Louka belongs to the lower class and works for the aristocratic Petkoffs as housemaid. Raina, as an aristocrat, tends to look down on Louka as she believes she is superior to her by reason of birth. For instance, she will not want Louka to tell the family what to do when the latter warns them to take cover against the smoking guns.</p><p>On her part, Louka does not accept an inferiority status and sees Raina as her equal irrespective of her aristocratic status. And so she does not hesitate to call her by name. Raina begins as an idealist and seems to be enamoured of Major Sergius owing to his so-called chivalry and heroism on the warfront. She does not appear to know what she actually wants in him. Therefore she continues to waste time, day-dream and date both Serguis and Bluntschli at different times. On the contrary, Louka is a realist and a schemer. She knows what she wants in marriage from the outset. Her grand design is to use marriage to climb up the social ladder and join the likes of the Petkoffs at the top. And she deploys everything, including boldness, eaves-dropping, gossip, blackmail, wit and seduction to turn Sergius and Raina against each other and then wins Sergius as would-be-husband. Raina is complacent and believes that her social status is a sufficient credential to make anybody fall in love with her. Louka, on her own part, knows her limitations as an underdog. She never takes things for granted and she always keeps her ears to the ground. That explains why she boldly retorts: </p><p>\"My love is at stake i I am not ashamed\" when Raina accuses her of jealousy and eavedropping. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>There is a lot of lying and insincerity in the play as a whole. On various occasions, the characters evade the truth and put on dubious appearances. Catherine leads the way in this evasion of the truth. Having enjoyed the hospitality of Catherine and her daughter, Captain Bluntschli returns to restore the coast he has borrowed and to thank the women for coming to his rescue. He arrives at a bad time because Petkoff and Segius are in the house. Catherine is unable and unwilling to let the others in on her secret. She covers up through telling obvious lies. She insists on taking Sergius' place in solving the problem of sending the three regiments to Philoppopolis so that Sergius and Raina may be alone. She is particularly afraid for the relationship between Sergius and Raina should the truth become known. Already Catherine has managed to tell a lie regarding the whereabouts of her husband's coat. When Louka announces a Swiss officer, Catherine knows who it is at once. She is determined that her husband should not know about the presence of the newcomer. When it becomes clear that Petkoff has actually seen the man already, Catherine declares that she has been trying to persuade the Captain to stay for lunch but he'd rather leave.</p><p>This is a lie. It is a hint to the man to leave the family alone. When Raina enters and blurts out her familiarity with the man, the game is nearly given away. She recovers quickly and tells a tale to cover up her recognition of Captain Bluntschli. Catherine backs her daughter's lie for obvious reasons: their acquaintance with the Swiss officer must not be known. Then Nicola arrives with the man's bag as Catherine has instructed. She denies knowledge of what Nicola is talking about. Nicola takes a chiding from Petkoff and is threatened with dismissal. Catherine dare not own up the truth. Having told one lie, she must back it up with others. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Satire occurs in a variety of situations in the play. Gwendolen is extraordinarily obsessed with the name 'Ernest', rather than with earnestness itself. This attitude of hers shows how members of the society set so much store by appearances and affectations. Wilde uses Lady Bracknell's interrogation of Jack to satirize the values of a society which puts premium on social connections and downplays good character. Marriage in this society is based on wealth rather than on good behaviour. Lady. Bracknells' list of eligible suitors does not include Jack who, presumably, has no name and no fortune.</p><p>Satire is also at work in the revelation scene. The inadvertent swapping of the baby with the manuscript of a mere novel is evidence of society's misplaced priority. The scene in which Jack woos Gwendolen shows the reverse of the assumptions about gender roles. Decorum requires that young women be weak and passive while men are supposed to be active, competent and authoritative. Yet, Jack stammers ineffectually and Gwendolen actively controls the whole business of the proposal. The rigid nature of Victorian conventions is exposed as Gwendolen insists that Jack start the whole marriage proposal over again in the conventional way. The same essentially applied to the Cecily Algernon relationship. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Gwendolen is Algernon's cousin. She is also Lady Bracknell's daughter. She is not only elegant and fashionable, but also artificial and pretentious. She is in love with Jack because she finds him irresistible solely because of her belief that Jack's name is Ernest. She swears that she cannot marry any man who is not called Ernest. This obsession of Gwendolen's sustains the plot, as it stands in sharp contrast to Lady Bracknell's adherence to social convention. By what society approves, an eligible suitor cannot but be on her list, even if he is not Ernest. In contrast, Gwendolen's man need only be Ernest whether he is a man of enough substance to earn a place on her mother's list.</p><p>Gwendolen exposes the misplaced notion of the society about the nature of men. A man is seen as all strength, manliness and capability. Contrary to this, at the crucial moment, Jack stammers while Gwendolen takes over and steers the process of the marriage proposal herself. As part of the hypocritical system, she pretends, on her meeting Cecily that she does not mind being in the company of a girl of the countryside. The argument between her and Cecily when the two become entangled in the confusion of which Ernest each is in love with reveals their infatuation with symbols appearances rather than reality. Thus, it is Gwendolen's resolve to marry only a man named Ernest that moves the plot forward. Her position leads Jack to his desire to be christened. This in turn leads to revelation that Jack, after all, is Ernest. He actually has been christened as such. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the imagery in \"The Sunne Rising</p>",
        "answer": "<p>\"The Sunne Rising\" is ostensibly a confrontation between a lover and the rising sun. in the encounter the poet employs various images. The opening lines conjure a powerful image of intrusion. The sun is presented as an intruder who 'through windows and through curtains call on us'. The visitor is clearly unwelcome. The sun's intrusion actually makes the poet angry and he resorts to harsh words: \"Busie old fool, unruly sunne\". The sun is presented in the image of a busy-body who should take his meddlesome familiarity elsewhere - to rebuke 'late school boyes' sowre prentices' or provide service to 'court-huntsmen'. The image of the sun's powerful beam and his wink which can \"eclipse\" the sun is an interesting conceit. The poet patronizingly declines to pursue his challenge with the excuse that, he cannot afford to lose his mistress' sight.</p><p>Yet another image is that which involves the sun's age - \"thine age askes ease\" – as it performs its duty to shine on the whole world. By another metaphysical conceit, the whole world is shrunk into the poet's bedroom - \"these walls\" with the poet and his mistress at the centre. Thus by shining upon them, the sun reduces its labour of shining on the whole world which has now become the poet's bedroom. Reference can also be made to the image of the poet and his mistress as embodying all the riches of the world. This is seen in the lines - \"she's all States, and all Princes, I, / Nothing else is\". Thus, honour, prestige, wealth are possessed by them and the sun does well by providing services to them alone. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The poem confidently asserts that man is the author of his own life. The poet's view that \"man is his own star\" is consistent with the general belief that man is in control of his own destiny. This view is stressed throughout the poem as the poet pours scorn on the so-called astrologers and star-gazers. As man is created in the image of God who endows him with talents, the poet rightly contends that the sky is the limit for man who is in search of perfection. As such, man should be able to find his own bearing in life and shape the course of his own affairs, as \"nothing to him falls early or too late\".</p><p>The poem reveals that, in spite of the influence of the stars and other forces of nature, man's fate in life depends on his honesty. \"The soul that can/ render an honest and perfect man, commands all light...\". For it is man's action or inaction that makes or breaks him as is expressed in the line, \"our acts our angels are, or good or ill.\" The poet therefore condemns those who rely on outside forces to shape their destiny because God has empowered man to be the master of his own fate and should rely on him for direction. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The novel provides a graphic picture of a society that is rooted in custom and tradition and Pokuwaa is no exception. Her devotion to carrying out the sacrifices and purification rites marks her out as a devotee of tradition. However, there is loss of confidence and disenchantment when she discovers that in spite of this religious devotion through sacrifices to the gods, her ambition is far from being realized. When thunder strikes the baobab tree outside the village, the people of Brenhoma feel it is a bad omen and that the gods are angry and must be pacified. Pokuwaa seriously takes part in the purification rites, praying that the gods will make her fertile. She has performed several purification rites to the god Tano and has consulted several herbalists without success. To add to her disappointment, she realizes that there is little difference between the herbal medicines given to her by the Tano priest and the ones she has received from other herbalists - medicines which has failed to work. This accentuates her doubts about the efficacy of traditional medicine. Her doubts even extend to the belief in ancestral influences.</p><p>Her journey to the Ananse stream, though made in ignorance, reveals an attitude of mind that has given up the idea of strictly following the tradition of the society. When Pokuwaa is urged to return the hornbill which she has caught from an eagle, she goes just a few yards into the bush and throws the hornbill away. </p><p>The resolve by Pokuwaa to discontinue making sacrifices to the gods is an expression of dissatisfaction with the state of affairs. She destroys the pot she has hitherto used to prepare the herbal drugs and burns the talisman she has worn round her waist. After she has done all these, she experiences peace. Thus her becoming pregnant only after she has discontinued the sacrifice, is a vindication of her refusal to adhere slavishly to tradition and spells victory for her: </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Yaw Boakye is an important member of the Brenhoma community. He leaves on a Monday to go hunting and does not return home. In keeping with the practice of the community, a search party is organized. The search for Yaw Boakye highlights the gregarious nature of the society. It shows that people are concerned about the welfare of others. The young men of the village do not need any prompting: they turn up in their numbers to take part in the search as soon as Boakye's disappearance is announced. Their commitment to seeking each other's welfare is not in doubt. They drop all that they are engaged in and concentrate on finding their kinsman, dead or alive. Pokuwaa's concern for the welfare of her husband `Kwadwo' comes out during the search for Boakye. She does not want him to be the first to come upon the hideous sight of Boakye's corpse. She has seen it and does not want to subject her husband to the horror which it holds, if she can prevent it. She therefore directs him to conduct his search far away from where she knows the corpse is.</p><p>The search also demonstrates the highly organized structure of Brenhoma's society. The men are divided into several groups, each group led by a captain whose authority is undisputed. Further, the search heightens suspense in the novel. As the men move slowly in groups toward the corpse of Boakye, the narrator captures their every movement. The suddenness of the end of the search surprises even the reader. As vultures whirl overhead, the reader suspects that the men are approaching Boakye's corpse. But the end comes suddenly, encoded in traditional register: \"Wasps! Wasps! Take care!\". Soon the drums are relaying the message \"We mourn Yaw Baokye. Condolences\".</p><p>Finally, the search highlights the belief in superstition which plays an important role in the lives of the people. Even though there is as yet no evidence that Yaw Boakye is dead, the searchers have come to the conclusion that what Pokuwaa has reportedly seen a couple of days earlier has been Boakye's ghost. Thus as they proceed in their search for him, the fear of encountering his ghost lingers in their minds. </p>",

When it comes to punishment, Eugene and Aunt Ifeoma punish firmly and promptly any infraction of their children. Whereas lfeoma is humane and restrained, Eugene is harsh and unreasonable. Throughout the novel, Aunt lfeoma is not seen punishing her children much. According to Amaka's account of punishment to Kambili, each time Aunt lfeoma punishes them she explains the reason for the punishment. Amaka confesses in her usual, frank manner that she prefers her punishment not be linked with any attempt of justification. Aunt lfeoma is seen constantly guiding her erring children with physical punishment.</p><p>On one occasion, however, she does what she must do. Her eldest son, present during a conversation with her friend rudely shows his disagreement with her by cutting into their conservation. His mother promptly orders him to shut up and to go upstairs immediately. She apologises to her friend and, after her friend has left, she follows the youth upstairs, slaps and gives him a thrashing. She tells him that she will not tolerate insolence. She is not opposed to her son disagreeing with her friend. It is his manner of approach that she punishes. Eugene, on the other hand, goes to the extreme and does not weigh his punishment with the gravity of the offence. Scalding the children's feet deliberately for living with their 'heathen' grandfather without informing him is no way to punish a child. Again, when Kambili attempts to collect the pieces of her grandfather's torn painting she is beaten mercilessly and ends up in hospital. He explains to the children that the punishment is for their own good. It seems Eugene like Aunt lfeoma does not hate his children.

Eugene's children have a strict schedule on how to conduct themselves. There is a strict limit to their liberty. In Aunt Ifeoma's home, however, the children are allowed to grow up as children and play without restriction to their freedom. </p>",

It is not long after this that he dies in his sleep while with them at Nsukka. Papa-Nnukwu is a humorist as opposed to his grave and unsmiling son Eugene. Whenever he is with his grandchildren he is either telling them traditional folktales or making jokes with them. He is a good entertainer.</p><p>Thus, Amaka, Obiora and Chima can hardly stay away from him for long. His role in the novel helps to lighten the tense atmosphere of tragedy that pervades it. While going out sightseeing with the grandchildren in Aunt Ifeoma's car, he creates laughter when he says, \"What are those children saying gbo Ifeoma?... Are they conspiring to share my gold and many lands?\" Here we see the old man trying to put aside the communication barrier between him and his grandchildren. Again, he exaggerates his height, by saying that in his `youthful days he could pluck \"icheku\" from the trees by just reaching out high'.</p><p>This also exudes humour. He respects his own religion just as Eugene respects his but Papa Nnukwu is not fanatical about his. He prays for Eugene just as he prays for his daughter and grandchildren. He even prays for his enemies - an embodiment of a perfect traditionalist, and not a heathen. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Jack competes with Ralph for leadership of the group the very day the boys arrive and find themselves on the island. He is over-ambitious. He despises Piggy because of his ability to reason and Ralph because of his charisma. Jack does not want to follow protocol as they have all agreed. Rather, he is more inclined by nature to rule with force and give orders as he wishes without being questioned or seeking the others' views. Jack is violent and blood-thirsty by nature and makes a reckless display of these in public. Jack, together with Roger, masterminds a reign of terror on the island. He trains the boys to become savages. Jack's love for power crowds out his thought of rescue. He concludes that they may not be rescued and the best course is to enjoy the game of survival. Thus he breaks away from the boys, and sets up his own community, where he can be the leader and dictate to his boys.</p><p>Jack wins the boy's support by creating avenues for them to have fun as he involves them in games and killing pigs for food. He also makes the boys dance which results in the accidental killing of Simon who is mistaken for the dreaded beast. Eventually the conch and assembly become ineffectual and the island becomes a place for the survival of the fittest. Piggy's pair of spectacles is stolen; and in the course of attempting to retrieve it, Piggy gets killed by Roger. Ralph is marked for death, as he is smoked out of his hiding, before being rescued by the naval officer. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON — AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>WILLIAM GOLDING: Lord Of The Flies</strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss fear as a dominant theme in the novel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Fear runs all through the novel, and dictates the behaviour of the boys. Right from the day they appear on the island, the boys are seized with various types of fear. These manifest in some of the boys and in their general comportment. The fear of being marooned forever is Piggy's immediate preoccupation. He pesters Ralph with his sentiments. Not even Ralph's assurance that his own father, a pilot, will come for them in due course will allay Piggy's fears. Throughout his existence on the island, Piggy draws attention to actions that are likely to get them rescued, such as running to swim and keeping the fire going. All the boys, except perhaps Simon, are afraid of the beast. The beast is not known and so the fear of it is not tangible.</p><p>Perhaps this is what makes the boys' situation as dangerous as it is. This type of fear leads them to tackle their uneasiness by trial and error — hunting, dancing and fighting in order to sweep the fear under the carpet. Ralph is particularly afraid that the unity of the group may disintegrate and the group may become debased. What begins as .a mere reminder to the boys to use the toilet and drinking and washing places as designated, turns real when the boys break into two antagonistic groups. Despite Jack's outward show of toughness and capacity to lead, he struggles to hide his own fear of the beast. He tries hard to look natural, but intimidates others to feel on top of events. He easily keeps a boy tied up awaiting his pleasure; he dictates who may have meat, and offer Ralph and the others meat because he decides to. Jack's fear intensifies with the murder of Simon and hardens into a strong desire to eliminate Ralph. In this development, Ralph looks like a prophet. His premonitions and real dislike of Jack's behaviour are significant.</p><p>Though fear seems to be collectively felt by the boys, Simon appears to be the only one not affected like the others. Naturally, without fear, he demystifies the fear in the novel. Insightfully, he comments that the beast might just be themselves. This observation, which might have saved these boys, is ignored. Simon's ultimate discovery is never revealed as he is killed by the others, who remain afraid of the beast, which he has discovered to be a harmless, undignified, dead man. It may be said that several actions of the children are driven by fear of one kind or the other. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON — AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: The Old Man and The Sea </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine the use of flashback and monologue in the novel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The use of flashback provides the reader with ample information about Santiago's past family life and failures. Through this means, the reader learns that Santiago teaches Manolin to fish and that they have both gone on several fishing expeditions before. Through the flashback device, the reader also discovers that, as a young man, the old man, known as Santiago El Campeon, is a bundle of energy. It is this vigorous energy that the unleashes to defeat the great negro of Cienfuegos in a nerve-racking hand game. It is also through the use of flashback that the reader learns of Santiago's love for baseball, and his liking for beer and coffee. All these serve to bring out the humanity of Santiago, and make it easier for the reader to empthathize with him in his travails at sea.</p><p>The use of monologue also runs through the novel. By this means, the old fisherman talks to himself on several occasions. So also does he address the aquatic and aerial creatures, including the great fishes and the sharks he has to contend with as though they could hear him and respond. In a particular monologue, Santiago does not fail to recognize the strong affinity between man and the elemental forces, in spite of the relentless struggle between them and man. He believes that like us, the elements have feelings and that they deserve not only understanding but also love and respect. For instance, he sees the sea as feminine —la mar — and something that can give or withhold favors and that if she does wild or wicked things at times, it is because she cannot help it. He equally believes that the marlin he traps and wants to kill also has the right to live, struggle for dear life and kill him in self-defence. The use of monologue therefore enables the reader to have an insight into the old man's subconscious and inner self, especially his deep feelings about the marlin, Manolin, human nature and the quintessential stuff he himself is made of. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON — AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: The Old Man and The Sea </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss Santiago's struggle with the Marlin. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The marlin is an extraordinary big fish that Santiago uses much of his time struggling to catch. Going without catching a fish for eight-four days, Santiago has almost been certain that the fish he will catch eventually will be a large fish. When the old man sets out on the day of his catch, he is businesslike. From his experience, he knows the exact measurement of the lengths of line, and the various depths at which different fish may be caught. He waits patiently, telling himself to fish the day well. Santiago is ready when the marlin bites. He allows the fish to settle for the struggle, as he lets the line run through his fingers. This strategy makes it certain that the fish does not panic, for it must not feel any tension in the line at this point.</p><p>Santiago idolizes the marlin and sees it as his own brother. He urges himself to match the fish's nobility. He tells himself that he has to prove worthy of the fish, when he catches it. As the fish takes the bait and appears to take his time, Santiago fantasizes about what the fish's actually doing and the actual manner of the fish's eating of the sardines. He urges the marlin to be decorous and not spoil the event. Soon the fish begins to move seaward, at first turning slowly. The old man tries to haul it in, but the fish stays down, moving further and further to sea. As they move, seaward, Santiago resolves not to hurry the struggle but hold on steadily, as the fish draws him away to sea, and give it line as is appropriate.</p><p>For a long time, the marlin drags the old man about. He talks to the fish even though he does not see it. He misses the boy and talks to himself regarding his not having salt. He is afraid that his hand might become cramped at the crucial time.</p><p>Eventually, the fish rises to the surface and is caught, killed and strapped to the skit. But for sharks, this would have been the end of the struggle, Sharks, however, extend the man's struggle. Now he must save the fish from being stolen by sharks. In this he fails, and bring to shore only the skeleton of the marlin. Yet Santiago, as far as his friend, the boy, is concerned, does not lose the fight against the fish. He has given a good account of himself, and from now onwards he will go to sea with the boy. At any rate, that is the boy's decision. Though he loses the fish, he emerges triumphant, and in high spirit. Santiago's catch draws admiration from his colleague fishermen and tourists alike. They are full of respect for him in the end. </p>",
