        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>KOBINA SEKYE: The Blinkards</strong></p><p> </p><p>How is African Life presented in the play?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The Blinkards is about how people perceive the way of life of the African and that of the European. One viewpoint is that the European way is superior to the African.</p><p>In presenting African life as not only adequate but also appropriate for the African environment, Sekyi uses satire which makes Mrs. Borofosem and her condemnation of African life look ludicrous. The position of Mrs. Borofosem, members of the Cosmopolitan Club and others like them is that African life is crude. Mainly through the influence of African Mrs. Borofosem, characters like Okadu and Miss Tsiba adopt this stance towards African culture.</p><p>Mrs. Borofosem and her ilk assume that the things that Europeans do are what should be done and that the way they do them is the way things should be done. For this reason, she does and sees things through an obviously faulty perception of the European life she so highly extols. She naturally begins her attack on African culture at home. To her husband's chagrin, he must not sing Fanti songs! He must drop cigar ash on the carpet and not wear cloth. He is under obligation to kiss his wife at random and call her `cluckie' because \"Mrs Gush my friend at Seaborne on the East Coast is always addressed by her husband as 'cluckie.</p><p>Through Mrs. Borofosem influence over Miss Tsiba and the ahyentarfo Mrs. Borofosem decrees that European dress be preferred to African cloths and African food and drink be regarded as unwholesome for civilized persons. It is ironical that Mrs. Borofosem herself does an about-turn to embrace African life, acknowledging that her earlier attitude has been a mistake.</p><p>Mr Onyimdze, Nana Katawerwa and Na Sompa and the atamfurafo hold a contrary view. For them, an African must look like and be African.</p><p>Mr Onyimdze is attached to his culture. However, he accommodates the European way. He does not reject European dressing; he wears his lawyer's robe and regards it as appropriate for his calling. However, after work, he takes it off, preferring African clothes. His diet comprises both European and African foods, hence when Miss Tsiba and Mrs. Borofosem visit Mr Onyimdze in his home, Miss Tsiba may choose between a cake and boredzentotoe.</p><p>The Mrs. Borofosem and Onyimdze factions clash continually until the advocates of African culture prevail through Onyimdze's winning of the court case for Nana Katawerwa. All in ail, African life is presented as adequate and suitable for the Africans. It is now left to Mr Borofosem, who has not defended African culture that strongly to admit that \"Really, Onyimdze was right all along ...\" </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>KOBINA SEKYE: The Blinkards</strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the role of Mr. Okadu in the play?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Mr Okadu is a clerk in Chutney's store. He is one who follows western beliefs and practices blindly and treats African customs contemptuously. He cuts a ludicrous figure in his attempt to ape the white man with his bad English and his ridiculous mannerism.</p><p>In presenting the character of Mr Okadu, the playwright satirizes Africans who copy western beliefs and practices indiscriminately. For example, when Mr. Onyimdze suggests at the garden-party that they should speak Fanti, Mr Okadu objects: \"Why, sir, this is a garden-party, sir-English idea. We must talk English, sir.\" This characterizes his behaviour throughout the play.</p><p>Mr. Okadu serves as a destabilizing force in the Tsiba household. His relationship with Miss Tsiba tears the home apart. First, it is a source of conflict between Mr. Tsiba and his wife, Na Sompa. Mr Tsiba supports the union because he sees in it a route to enhancing the status of his family. Na Sompa is incensed and does not conceal her hatred for Okadu. Na Sompa quits her home because of her opposition to the union and threatens never to speak to her husband again. Furthermore, the relationship between Mr Okadu and*Miss Tsiba results in Na Sompa's heart failure and eventual death. This accentuates the negative influence of Mr Okadu on those around him.</p><p>Okadu epitomizes the alienated African who attempts to defend the beliefs and values he has uncritically adopted when they come under threat. For example, when Okadu's marriage to Miss Tsiba is threatened with dissolution, he drags Miss Tsiba to court on a charge of bigamy. He is stubborn and refuses to let go even though it is clear that he has little support. Interestingly, this action leads to the climax of the play. The triumph of lawyer Onyimdze over Mr Okadu in court symbolizes a triumph of traditional values over imported western beliefs and practices. This hastens Mrs. Borofosem's rehabilitation at the end of the play. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>FEMI OSOFISAN: Women of Owu</strong></p><p> </p><p>Examin the role of the supernatural in the play</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The supernatural looms large over the people of Owu and keeps the entire Kingdom under its influence. It is the combined acts of the gods and the blessing of Edumare, the Supreme God of the Yorubas that culminate in building and making Owu the safest of all Yoruba cities. But it is also the action or inaction of the same gods that leaves the same city in ruins. This is attested to by no less a goddess than Lawumi, the ancestral Queen mother and goddess of the Owus during her conversation with Anlugbua after the fall of the kingdom.</p><p>The fall of Owu does not come as a surprise to the gods, especially, Lawumi. The fall is even supernaturally contrived, aided and abetted. It is in fact the logical and deserved consequence of Owu's condemnable acts of omission or commission.</p><p>One such act is the Owu people's blatant show of arrogance not only to Lawumi but also to the Ile Ife, the cradle of the Yorubas. \"Drunk with prosperity\" the Owus throw caution to the wind and sack Apomu, Ife's commercial satellite town, and send people away into slavery. By so doing they break the sacred law of Sango, the Yoruba god of thunder, that no Yoruba man shall sell his compatriot into slavery. For this, Owu must be punished by the gods and it is with the consuming fire power of the Allied Forces. The pervasive influence of the supernatural is also seen in the unfailingly gloomy prediction of the Oracle. Through the priest, the Oracle warns that prince Dejumo must be killed in his cradle or else he will ultimately bring gloom and doom to the Kingdom. However, Erelu, the mother, ignores the warning and spares the life of the son. The ill-fated prince grows up and abducts lyunloye after the sack of Apomu. The aggrieved husband, an artist-turned-soldier, leads the Allied Forces to invade Owu and deStroy it even beyond Lawumi's wildest imagination.</p><p>But the supernatural influence is not over yet because the destruction of Owu does not leave Lawumi and even Ogun — the god of metallic ore' unbruised. The gods agree to collaborate with Lawumi to avenge the apparent excesses of the Allied Forces in flattening and desecrating their shrines even as women and children throng there to seek refuge. And as Orumnila — the god of divination, predicts, the return of the Allied Forces will be filled with grief; Esu will create problems for them at every cross-road; Orisa Oko will turn forests against them while Anlugbua, the ancestral father and deity, will unleash storms on them on their homeward journey. With their lives largely ruled and controlled by the supernatural, the Owu people seem to have no doubt in their minds that all this will come to pass. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>To the casual observer, Maye, a successful artist, suddenly turned soldier, leads the Owu campaign for selfless and patriotic reasons. One reason is the need to punish Owu for attacking Apomu, the commercial satellite town of Ife. The other is to stop the slave trade. However, a close examination of Maye's real motive reveals other reasons.</p><p>Maye is essentially an artist, not known to be a warmonger. Rather, he is a lover and defender of all that makes life worth living. And so he will rather go to war for reasons of romance than those of heroism. As events later show, the motive behind the man's war exploits is the burning desire to reclaim lyunloye, his abducted beautiful wife. Against all expectations that Maye will summarily execute lyunloye for her promiscuity, he allows her to defend herself — an opportunity that lyunloye seizes to seduce and bewitch him. Maye, against very stiff opposition, especially from Erelu, rules that lyunloye will no longer be killed in Owu but in Ife. To the dismay of soldiers and civilians alike, Maye and lyunloye go back to Ife in the same caravan in a most erotic mood. This is how Maye actualizes his hidden agenda. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>BERNARD SHAW: Arms and the Man</strong></p><p> </p><p>What are your impressions on Sergius as a Soldier? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Major Sergius Saranoff is a Bulgarian army commander who leads his regiment to win a battle against the Serbs at Silvinitza. However, both his critics and admirers consider him to be a failure and he admits he is. To Catherine, who sees him as a future son-in-law and to Raina his fiancée, he is no doubt the gallant and the perfect soldier. But he is an inexperienced soldier who leads \"a charge on his own responsibility\" and blindly \"sweeps through the guns with ordinary swords\". </p><p>Bluntschli's assessment of his performance at the warfront is even more damning. Bluntschli describes him as a foolish, tactless and quixotic soldier who, without initiative, fights at close range with swords against enemies with fire arms. He is \"like a drum major\" and he and his men are like \"fools let loose on a field of battle\" where he leads them to commit suicide. Because Sergius is an inexperienced soldier, he does not know how to save the lives of his troops. As he foolishly owns up himself, he conserves his own life but losses all his men while the Russian mercenaries lose only two generals but preserve all their men. As a tactless and inexperienced soldier who wantonly wastes the lives of his men on the battle field, Sergius's conquest of the Serbs at Silvinitza is therefore seen as a pyrrhic victory. For this reason Major Petkoff refuses to promote him after the war. This is why he resigns prematurely from the army. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Major Petkoff's coat makes a significant contribution to the development of the plot. Much of the action of the play hinges on Bluntschli's 'borrowing' of Major Petkoffs coat and its return, which builds the play's suspense.</p><p>Bluntschli, a Swiss mercenary fighting on the side of the Serbs, in a bid to escape from his pursuers, strays into the bedroom of Raina, Major Petkoff's daughter. He needs to escape and Raina, already attracted to him, lends him her father's coat to facilitate his escape. The coat is therefore used to advance the plot as it serves as a vehicle for Bluntschli's escape from Bulgaria. Raina places her portrait in the pocket of the coat. This raises further complications in the plot of the play. When Bluntschli returns the coat, he gives it to Catherine with Raina's portrait still in the pocket. Major Petkoff has noticed that the coat is missing although his wife has tried to convince him to believe the contrary. When he finds the coat, he sees Raina's portrait in it.</p><p>He, however, keeps quiet, waiting for a satisfactory explanation. As he is preparing to go with Major Sergius and Captain Bluntschli for the rehabilitation of the Bulgarian soldiers, he calls for the coat. Cleverly taking the coat from Nicola, Raina stealthily removes the portrait before putting the coat on her father. To her father's surprise the portrait is no longer in the pocket. This development provokes an anxious moment of accusation about who may have removed it. To everybody's surprise but relief also, Bluntschli speaks up and the whole story surrounding the escape is told at no cost to the major players. The matter is, therefore, resolved to the satisfaction of all. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>OSCAR WILDE: The Importance of Being Earnest </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the use of humour in the play.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The play abounds with humour. The most serious matters are dealt with humourously and the mannerisms of some of the characters exude humour.</p><p>First we see Algernon eating up the cucumber sandwiches he has prepared for his aunt; his denial creates humour. It might have been a serious situation, perhaps, had it ben a matter between aunt and nephew alone. But Lady Bracknell's question elicits a lie from the master of the house, and this untruth is humorously supported by the servant, such that the audience wonders whether it has not been rehearsed. There is also the lineage of Jack which is another source of humour. Lady Bracknell's interview is, in itselt humorous. But the purpose and method are even more so.</p><p>Among many other things she suggests to Jack in her interview, she asks Jack to \"acquire some relations as soon as possible\". How he is to do this and \"produce at any rate one parent... before the season is quite over\" is ridiculously funny.</p><p>The quarrel between Gwendolen and Cecily is funny. especially when we remember Algemon's comment that two women meeting for the first time must quarrel to get on. As we watch Cecily carefully ask what Gwendolen will have, and offer her her dislikes, we find the country girl matching the city girl boot for boot. Lady Bracknell's surprise when Dr Chausuble asks Jack and Algernon whether they are ready for the christening is an occasion for humour. Apparently her ladyship is under the impression that the unborn child of her daughter and Jack is the object of the christening.</p><p>Jack's anger with Algernon leads to revelations that are complicated and funny. With Lady Bracknell determined to defend her nephew's honour, Jack is raging that Algernon has \"obtained admission\" to the house by pretending to be his brother. But Algernon is Jack's brother, anyway. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>OSCAR WILDE: The Importance of Being Earnest </strong></p><p> </p><p>How important is marriage in the play?</p>",
        "answer": "<p> Marriage is an important theme in the play. All the major characters are deeply concerned with the issue of marriage and at one time or the other express strong views on this issue. It serves as a force which motivates most of the important actions in the play. Further, it forms the subject of many arguments and very lively, if not heated, debates.</p><p>The issue of marriage is brought into every conversation, however trivial it may be. Right at the start of the play Algernon broaches the subject in a conversation with his butler, Lane. He asks the question: \"why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?\" Lane's response hits straight home at the point: \"I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine... I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.\" They then launch into a short conversation on the nature of marriage in which Lane remarks that he does not find the subject of marriage an interesting topic for discussion. This leads to Algernon's comments, when Lane insists that \"Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax\".</p><p>The conversation between the friends, Jack and Algernon, inevitably touches on the issues of marriage. Jack's sincere belief in the romanticism of marriage is countered by Algernon's cynical views. While Jack expresses the wish to always enjoy the company of his wife when he does marry, Algernon insists that the married man should always create an alter ego which will give him an opportunity to run away from his wife from time to time. Algernon's views, of course, change when he falls in love with Cecily.</p><p>The question of marriage occupies the top spot in Lady Bracknell's list of priorities. Her perspective on marriage is expressed solely from a materialistic viewpoint. Her \"list of eligible young men\" does not, therefore, include Jack who wants to marry her niece, Gwendolyn.</p><p>Lady Bracknell puts status first: \"a man should always have an occupation of some kind\". Her \"list of eligible young men\" is based on social status and wealth. Therefore, Jack with his \"nondescript origin\" having been found abandoned in a handbag at Victoria Station will never make her list.</p><p>Lady Bracknell' s interview of Jack accentuates the ludicrousness of her criteria for eligibility. For her, \"a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing. To Jack's response that he knows nothing she says: \"I am pleased to hear it\". Wilde is certainly poking fun at Victorian ideals of marriage here. The important issues, such as a person's character takes the back seat: \"I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is not good thing\" (Lady Bracknell). As it turns out, Jack is actually Lady Bracknell's nephew - and Algernon's brother! This accentuates the foolishness of prohibiting marriage on the grounds that the proposed suitor's background is undistinguished. After all, she admits herself that when she married Lord Bracknell she had no fortune of her own but that she \"never dreamed for one moment of allowing that to stand in my way\". </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Expelled is a poem which addresses problems associated with change in the persona's life. The change is externally induced and it can be inferred from the poem that it is brought about by colonialism. The first two lines are suggestive: \"We had traded in this market place competitively perfect /Till you came in the boat</p><p>...\". What is suggested here is an erstwhile communal life in which everyone understands the rules of the game, but not so any longer. The colonialists (you) virtually destroyed everything, material and spiritual. This fact is expressed in the lines: 'cut our ribs, dried our cows' etc.</p><p>The allusion to Sodom and Gomorrah completes the picture of the perversion and destruction that colonialism brings about generally.</p><p>At the personal level, it is suggested that the persona never overcomes the suffering colonialism inflicts upon his compatriots. He refers to his personal loss, as living in both poverty and penury, unable to pay his debtors who \"tapped my rusty door\". Now he has become a pariah, as everyone avoids him while he himself plays hide and seek with death. Nature itself offers no consolation, as the \"broken lines run across my face\", indicating his ageing too quickly. The last two lines with their image of the auctioneer hammering away the goods left behind are pathetic in their confirmation of the total deprivation that has become his lot. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>In what ways are the fortunes of the Rich and the poor linked in \"Homeless not Hopeless\"? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The poor in the poem do not have homes. They live \"under bridges\". But they come to terms with their situation with equanimity. They see themselves as significant and playing a particularly active and useful role in society.</p><p>By their situation, the poor rely on the rich for survival. But they work for their upkeep. They rise at daybreak and ply their trade and \"beg for alms\".</p><p>The curious thing about the occupation of the poor beggars is that it sustains the system. They are clear-eyed and fully aware that they form a \"necessary part of your society\". It is ironical, even paradoxical, that the rich should imagine that they are removed from the world of the poor.</p><p>As the persona puts it, the poor people are the \"translators of your dreams\". This refers to the rich of the society, who have everything while the poor have nothing. The poor say that they carry the burdens of the rich.</p><p>This is significant because it hits at the very root of offering alms. Anyone who gives alms wants to be blessed. In requesting and accepting alms, therefore, the poor are \"angels\" who \"open gates of blessing\" for the rich.</p><p>The link between poverty and wealth is put succinctly in the paradox of the couplet: \"we are the lack that take your lack\". The rich lack blessings as much as the poor lack wealth. When the wealthy give the poor a little of their possession, the acceptance of the offer of alms opens the gates of blessings for the givers. In this way, the fortunes of the poor and those of the wealthy are intertwined. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>What is the poet's attitude towards the sun in \" The Sunne Rising\"?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The poet's attitude towards the sun is more complex than it first appears. There are two discernible attitudes which the poet adopts towards the sun.</p><p>Initially, the poet is irritated by the sun. He starts the monologue on a querulous note. The questions he asks indicate the irritation which the sun is causing him. The sun is personified as a \"Busy old fool\" who persists in waking him and his lover up even though no one has invited him to do so. The sun is, here, a busybody and might do well to mind his own business.</p><p>The poet's later diction reinforces his contempt for the sun whom he sees as a \"pedantic wretch\". This suggests the sun's unimaginative and ostentatious following of rules. The poet's distaste is obvious here. The implication is that the sun, if it wants to follow the rule of waking people up early daily, should look for others who are less earnestly engaged, such as \"late school boys and sour prentices\".</p><p>These others are engaged in mundane activities and should therefore be the target of the sun's rays. He and his lover are enjoying a relationship which is on a much higher level than the activities of \"court-huntsmen\" arid \"country ants\", so the sun, which really determines time, can have no effect on them. The poet's irritation is mitigated later. The sun is no longer a busybody. He focuses is on the sun's pretentiousness; \"Thy beams so reverend and strong/Why shouldst thou think?\" Thus the poet's conceit is a pointer to the fact that he believes that in the realm of things, the sun is really like a bleep on a screen. The poet could shut his eyes and the sun will cease to exist.</p><p>A further shift in the poet's attitude is discernible. He still feels that the sun is insignificant though the focus has now shifted to himself and his mistress — the two are the most important beings in the whole world: \"she is all states, and all princes I / Nothing else is\". At this point he patronizes the sun by referring to its age and suggesting that it needs some rest. By shining on them the sun will be doing its duty to the world. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The primary purpose of the poet is to debunk the astrologers' wild claim that they can read the positions and movements of the stars and use their observations to tell people's fortunes. The poet reminds the astrologers that it, is fate and not the so-called starry influences that unalterably determine events in people's lives. He argues that fate is God- ordained and is therefore above human knowledge. For this reason, nobody including the astrologers, can pretend to know the destiny of any other person. \"And no man knows his treasures, no, not you!\" He thus considers them as impostors for fraudulently using the so-called starry influences to fool and dupe such gullible people as are worried by issues of danger, position, love and the like.</p><p>The poet further argues that God, who made the stars which the astrologers daily read and fraudulently exploit to eke a living, does not reveal to anybody, not least the astrologers, His secret purpose of creating them. He reminds them of the helplessness of their Egyptian predecessors to save Pharaoh and his cohorts from the wrath of God in their futile confrontation with Moses. He sees them engaged in dubious calculations and permutations about the sacred purpose of the work of the creator which is beyond their limited comprehension. Accordingly, he dismisses them as charlatans who are as \"blind\" as their calculations and as \"drunken\" as their conjectures.</p><p>The poet accuses the astrologers of being presumptuous and holds out that man does not need their services, being favorably equipped by the Divine to achieve his set objectives. Accordingly, he condemns the fortunate tellers with their spurious claims as liars since it is only man and what he does that make or mar him. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>ASARE KONADU: A Woman In Her Prime </strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the superstitions beliefs and practices in the novel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The novel abounds with religious beliefs and practices. The people of Brenhoma believe in and worship deities, the most popular one being Tano whom they consider a great god. Fofie is the day set aside for the worship of this god. Fofie is a festive Friday which is observed every six weeks. The people go to the shrine, Tanofie, to worship and consult the ancestors for solution to their problems. On Folk, it is held that the \"gods and goddesses move among men to feast and grant people's requests\".</p><p>Consequently, the plot begins when Pokuwaa is prepared frantically to go to Tanofie to present the items that she has been asked to bring as a sacrifice to the gods so that her ancestors and the gods would bless her efforts to get a child. Koramoa, Pokuwaa's playmate and childhood friend, is also there to thank the gods for blessing her with a child. The people of Brenhoma also consult the deities and ask them to intervene on behalf of anyone who may have wronged others or, where the sins of the parents or ancestors ar being avenged on an individual. Pokuwaa has been told by the priest at Tanofie to get a black hen so that the deities could be sought to spare her the pain of not having a child of her own in case \"she herself had wronged anyone or if the sins of her parents or ancestors were being avenged on her?'. The people also believe in the power of evil spirits who inhabit tree tops and wreak all sorts of havoc on them.</p><p>There are stories, first, of an evil spirit turning a child into a chicken and slaughtering her, and another of a man turning himself into a crocodile and devouring a girl who jilted him. Pokuwaa holds on to these superstitions. \"When Pokuwaa's jet black hen meant for sacrifice gets missing, she concludes that this is perhaps 'the work of evil spirits \"who, knowing Tano's greatness, had spirited the hen away, to stop her from making her sacrifice\". The lightning that strikes the wawa tree is considered a bad omen. It is a sign that the gods are angry. To pacify them, the women are expected to cook, and prayers offered to appease the seventy-seven (77) gods. Brenhoma women are also prayed for to bear children, so that when the gods pay a visit, \"you will always find someone here to give you something to eat\". The people also believe that another world called asamando exists where their ancestors reside, a place where there is no pain or suffering. All manner of food is prepared for them.</p><p>This is demonstrated during the burial of Yaw Boakye when different kinds of food are prepared and placed on his bed. His widows also give him cowries to pay for his passage on his way to the world beyond. Another practice of the Brenhoma community also manifests during the burial when on his way to the cemetery his corpse seems to have been held by unseen forces. Libation has to be poured in order to facilitate easy passage and the bearers resume their movement. </p><p>Again at the cemetery, each of the three widows runs ahead and throws a pot. This is to severe their marital relationhip with the dead.</p><p>The hornbill episode is another incidence of the superstitious belief of the people. While Pokuwaa was at the river to fetch water, an eagle nearly slaps her. She kills the hornbill, wraps it with leaves and takes it home, as the women of the community stare at her. On showing the mother the dead hornbill she becomes troubled because, in the first instance, nobody has, the right to go to the Ananse stream on Akwasidae to fetch water. Secondly, a hornbill is said to be the food of the gods and as a result it must be returned if the family does not want to incur the wrath of the gods. A purification rite has to be carried out.</p><p>The observance of the Odwira festival meant to mourn the dead is central to the peoples' belief in the continuity of their existence. It is done with loud beating of drums, and vigils are kept for the celebration. It also serves as an occasion for lovers to meet as well as settle family disputes. </p>",

        "answer": "<p> Kambili and her brother, Jaja pay occasional visits to the home of Aunty Ifeoma in Nsukka. The contrast between Eugene's household and Aunty Ifeoma's home is strilcing and this reveals aspects of Kambili's character which have never before been seen.</p><p>Eugene's almost regimental behaviour has left Kambili a withdrawn, taciturn, if not forlorn child. The emotional aridity of Eugene's home contrasts sharply with the warm, vivacious and liberal atmosphere of Aunty Ifeoma's home. The children's visit to Aunty Ifeoma to spend time with her and her children after Eugene has beaten Kambili unconscious marks a watershed in the action of the novel. The short time they spend with Aunty Ifeoma exposes Kambili and Jaja to freedom and cordiality they have never ben exposed to before. Kambili, the quiet, withdrawn girl now starts to ask questions to probe her surroundings. An instance could be seen when Kambili overhear a discussion between Aunty Ifeorna and a colleague of hers about turmoil in the university. Kambili asks Amaka to explain what is happening in the university. In the past, this would have been unthinkable. Now, she is bold enough to question what is happening around her. While Eugene had conditioned her to an unquestionable acceptance to whatever he told her, Aunty Ifeoma's home has opened up a whole new vista of experience in which the child could demand to have a say in her own future. The chains of enslavement, as it were„ are now falling off.</p><p>On the domestic scene we notice a transformation and self discovery of Kambili who hitherto has found it difficult to handle household chores, now becoming a good cook and a warm conversationalist. Another aspect of Kambili's character revealed in Aunty Ifeoma's house is her open relationship to members of the opposite sex. Up to now, the dominant man in her life has been her father towering over her like a colossus, willing her to do his bidding and not to ask questions. Now, in Aunty Ifeoma's house, she meets another man, a different kind of man altogether, Father Amadi. Whereas in the past, the clergy have been synonymous with oppressive long church services made worse by her being compelled to fast for the first time, she meets a clergyman who has a human face. She therefore finds herself falling in love. The shy girl who in the past will not even consider having a relationship with the opposite sex now opens up to a man and starts looking forward to spending time with him. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The relationship between Kambili and Rev. Father Amadi shows that real love does not only engender happiness and peace of mind, but it can also be a durable bridge between social and spiritual values.</p><p>Father Amadi is a Roman Catholic priest at Nsukka and a friend of the Ifedioras while Kambili is the daughter of Eugene Achike in Enugu. The relationship between the two begins when Kambili is on a holiday with the Ifedioras in Nsukka. When she sees the priest during a visit to the Ifedioras, she quickly recognizes him as the one that conducts an Igbo worship on Palm Sunday in Enugu - a thing described by her father as a sin. From that moment, she begins to develop a secret love for him for one major reason; he unlike her father, is not a religious bigot.</p><p>Kambili's love for Father Amadi rapidly develops. She wears Amaka's shorts and tries to use the lipstick to please him while he also eagerly takes her to the stadium and accompanies her to her hairdresser's place. Kambili sees Father Amadi as someone rightly filling the vacuum created by her high-handed father, whose love for her only leads to 'fear and submission. On the contrary, she sees Father Amadi's love for her giving her hope and happiness and an opportunity. to break from her father's rigid moral code.</p><p>Kambili sees in Father Amadi a friend and an equal in whom she can confide. She does not hide her admiration of his handsomeness and wonders why he should remain a priest. She is also unhappy that Father Arnadi may leave her behind on his mission to Germany.</p><p>Father Amadi's love for Kambili is in a manner ambivalent. He grows fond of her. But Father Amadi has enough self-control to hold back his passion and lift his relationship up onto a finer plane befitting his status as a priest. His leaving for Germany serves as a relief to him, which leaves Kambili distressed. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Simon is an important character in the novel. He appears to be a little retarded, while others think him \"batty\". But his fits do not prevent him from being keenly insightful. </p><p>The circumstances of Simon's death are tragic and regrettable. He dies because of the timing of his re-emergence from the forest. Savagery has engulfed the boys and they are absolutely unable to design the beast; they do not care about their fellow man.</p><p>It is significant that by this death, the confirmation of Simon's earlier observation that the beast may be in the boys themselves will never be known. This death obliterates the light of civilization and insightful analysis. It can be seen that when Simon dies. hurting another severely no longer means anything to the tribe, if it had done so at all earlier;</p><p>When the argument at the assembly becomes a discussion of ghosts, Simon says that the beast may as well be the human being. This does not go down well with the rest. This is a point that might have been cleared had Simon not died.</p><p>Simon does see what the others have seen earlier. He does not run. He sees the strange sight for what it is and even without fear, reasons about dignity that the wind deprives the dead man of. So he relates the parachutist from his indignity in death. What is left is the revelation of what Simon has come to know. This knowledge would or might have restored sanity or prompted the savagery unleashed after Simon's murder. It appears as if his death opens the floodgates for further savagely and attack on decency. The boys have no qualms about further killing. The crushing of Piggy and the conch is closely linked with Simon's death in the sense that the questioning that Simon does is taken to a higher level by Piggy. At any rate the bespectacled \"fatty\" is the source of light and insight. Naturally, after the brave investigator of mysteries has been done in, the bringer of light follows as a matter of course.</p><p>With the death of Simon and Piggy, the silent antagonism between Jack and Ralph breaks into open confrontation and war as Jack and his tribe hunt Ralph.</p><p>It can be seen that the death of Simon is significant in several ways. By his death, the avenue to obtaining the key to the mystery of the beast is closed. In its place, the sluice gates for the unleashing of brutal attacks on civility are opened. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>WILLIAM GOLDING: Lord Of The Flies </strong></p><p> </p><p>Consider the view that the struggle for power is a major issue in the novel.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>From the moment Jack Merridew appears on the stage with an air of \"superiority and off-hand authority\" with his chorus boys, even as Ralph is already presiding over a meeting of a group of others rescued on the island, it is obvious that power is going to be a major issue in the novel.</p><p>Power is sweet and Jack and Ralph love it. Like all those who love it, they both equally lay claim to it but by different means and for different reasons. While Ralph relies on the privilege of holding the conch, Jack in turn exploits self-assertion as he says with brazen arrogance: \"I ought to be chief... because I'm chapter chorister and head boy\".</p><p>Through a popular vote the other boys elect Ralph their leader simply because of his size, his attractive appearance and, most importantly, because he has the conch although Jack seems to be the most obvious leader. This democratic process shows that power belongs to the people who take it away from or choose to give it to whoever they want. This is also demonstrated when Ralph again overwhelmingly defeats Jack in the second leadership contest unnecessarily forced on the boys by the rebellious Jack.</p><p>Power in the novel manifests itself in two distinct forms - inclusive and integrative. The inclusive form allows for power sharing arrangement. This is why Ralph insists on the use of meetings and dialogues to get issues resolved. It also explains why he wants to bring Jack on board by conceding to him the leadership of the choir boys after defending him in the struggle for power but power is also used to foster social cohesion and advance the cause of the people. For this reason, Ralph is earnestly concerned with the welfare of the boys and their immediate rescue.</p><p>On the other hand, power can be used autocratically as an end in itself. In this case, it is primarily wielded to advance the myopic interest of the ruler. Jack after seizing power builds a cult of personality around himself and unleashes a reign of terror on the island. The development is regretted and bemoaned even by Roger, his second-in-command. In the process, Jack leads his hunter boys from Rock Castle to the Beach Platform to destroy the shelter under construction, molest Piggy the voice of reason, and steal his glasses. It is also the same reign of terror that prematurely terminates Piggy's life in their wild and. maddening chase to kill Ralph.</p><p>Power corrupts as shown by Jack but when it is seen as an effective means to a useful end as demonstrated by Ralph, it is desirable. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Santiago, an old and experienced fisherman spends the most part of his days at sea. His fishing expeditions which often take him far away from the shore enable him to know and understand the ways of the sea and its creatures. They also give him a vantage ground from which he can have a clear view of birds and such other phenomena as the. stars, the moon and the sun. As a result of his experiences at sea and his intimate observation of birds, Santiago develops peculiar views about them.</p><p>For instance, the old man recognizes, respects and empathizes as well as talks to them as if they can hear him and respond like human beings. He does this at great length though his monologues. For example, he says \"if the others hear me talking out loud they would think I am crazy but since I am not crazy, I do not care\"</p><p>As opposed to the views of others, Santiago always thinks of the sea as a woman who gives or withholds great favours This may explain why he bemoans his bad luck rather than bear the sea any grudge for losing the marlin be catches.</p><p>The old man recognizes the ability of birds to give a fisherman an insight into where he can find fish to catch. Such is the warbler that circles over him and leads him to locate the marlin he kills. During his ordeal with the big fish, he feels sorry for turtles but is also inspired by them as he compares his heart to theirs which live long after they have been killed. Hence, he eats their white eggs all through May to be strong in September and October.</p><p>In his fantasies, Santiago regards fish including the sharks which he knows species by species and which also deprive him of his big catch not only as friends but also as nobler, more beautiful and more able although less intelligent brothers. He sees the sinister sharks not as mere scavengers but as creatures with friends, mothers and relatives in their own right. He kills them in self-defence and to protect his catch.</p><p>His unusual view about other creatures is most noticeable in his encounter with the marlin. He pities the fish in its moment of anger and anguish even as his own life is on the line. He catches and kills the fish since no one is worthy of eating it from its behaviour and great dignity. He acknowledges its equal right to live and kill him if in self-defence. He argues that he kills the marlin neither for money nor for food but simply for pride. He wishes that the big fish were like the moon, the stars and the sun that no man can kill. - </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Santiago lives in a shack by himself. He has lost his wife, whom he occasionally remembers by the few relics of her past existence. Though Santiago does have a home to return to at the close of a fishing day, that home is truly empty- no wife, no child and little property.</p><p>At home, Santiago is to be found with his friend, Manolin discussing football, or meals, or Africa and lions. Without Manolin, Santiago seems to have no reinforcement in life. His life is kept alive, hopeful and humane by his firm friendship with Manolin. He maintains Santiago.</p><p>Santiago's home life is reflected in his friend, Manolin. He is always concerned about the old man's diet. The two play the 'rice game' when they both know that the old man is going to have no supper. The least the boy can do is to humour the old man. The old than's daily baits are provided by Manolin, apparently from his own resources. The boy packs the old man's things for him and sees him 6ff to sea. He also welcomes the old man when he returns from sea. He leads him home and tells him the latest gossip. On the day of the big catch, on his return, only Manolin visits him.  of the other fishermen comes by. This seems to be the normal way things go, as Santiago appears never to visit anyone.</p><p>Manolin not only mitigates Santiago's circumstances by easing the old man's plight but also enters the pains of the old man's condition at home. Having resolved to buy Santiago the winter things he has neglected to provide him with, Manolin does not spare himself the trouble to secure rest and recovery for the old man. He is significantly overwhelmed by emotion as he goes about doing his duty.</p><p>Manolin asks that no one disturbs the old man's sleep. Then he breaks down weeping because of the state he finds the old man and blames himself for having neglected to take better care of him.</p><p>The old man's home life is tangled in the boy's who as young he is, discerns Santiago's needs. He goes at these ardently like a mother as well as a wife to Santiago. Manolin watches over Santiago as a mother does her ailing child. He never permits him to worry and always gives the old man reason to live on. </p>",
