The trapped air column is 13.7cm long at 0°C and 18.7cm long at 100°C.

Both the tube and thermometer are then firmly attached a half-meter rule and placed in a water bath as shown above. The water is stirred and its temperature \\(\\theta_{1}\\) at a steady state is noted. The corresponding length, \\(L_{1}\\) of the entrapped air is also noted and recorded. The water is gradually heated and stirred uniformly until another steady temperature, \\(\\theta_{2}\\) is attained and recorded. The corresponding length, \\(L_{2}\\) of the air column in the capillary tube is again read and recorded. The experiment is repeated to obtain more sets of readings.

To keep the rate of change of momentum per unit area (i.e pressure) the same, the molecules will have to travel longer distances betweon collision This implies increase in volume. </p>",

Radioactive substances can be dangerous if one is exposed to their radiations for a long time. Some of the radiations are highly penetrating and if the body is over-exposed to them, they can destroy the cells in tissues and upset the natural chemistry of the body. Examples include: – Leukaemia – Skin burns</p><p>(b) Advantages of fusion over fission include: (1) Easily achieved with lightest element so that nuclear repulsion is easily overcome as nuclei approach each other (2) Raw materials are cheaply available. (3) Produces less dangerous by products. (4) There is no upper limit to the mass of hydrogen that can be obtained. Very high temperature is required to overcome the coulomb repulsive forces between the two light nuclei.
