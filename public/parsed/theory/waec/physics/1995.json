When the platinum contacts touch ar,d the key k is closed, current passes through the primary coil and the core is magnetised.  The soft iron armature is then attracted so the, the platinum contacts separate and the circuit is broken. When this happens, the core loses its magnetism and the armature is pulled back by the spring so that contact is re-established. As the contact is repeatedly made and broken in the primary circuit, changes of magnetic flux take place and induces an e.m.f. in the secondary coil.
