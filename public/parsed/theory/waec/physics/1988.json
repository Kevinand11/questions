Sound will thus be produced. However as the air inside the bell jar is gradually pumped out using a vacuum pump via the opening, the intensity of the sound produced by the electric bell gradually dies down even though the hammer is still seen striking the gong. When the air has been pumped out and the bell jar becomes empty (vacuum), the intensity of the sound dies almost completely. This shows that sound requires a material medium (air in this case) for transmission.</p><p>The three characteristics of sound are:</p><p>1. Intensity or Loudness: depends on amplitude.</p><p>2.
