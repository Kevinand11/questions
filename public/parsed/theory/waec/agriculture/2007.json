        "answer": "<p>(a) Explanation of management practices in animal production: (i) Steaming up: This is a process of giving highly nutritious diet to a pregnant animal for a few weeks before parturition to stimulate milk synthesis and secretion. (ii) Culling: This is the removal of unproductive or diseased or abnormal animal from the flock to prevent spread of diseases or create enough space for better production/performance. (iii) Candling: This is the process by which hatchable eggs are placed on a device called candler with a high light source below it in a dark room to reveal the presence or absence of developing embryo. This is normally done before the eggs are placed in an i incubator and mid-way during incubation to detect the presence of dead embryos. (iv) Weaning: This is the separation of the young animals from their mothers so that they can feed on their own and be independent of their mothers breast milk. (v) Tattooing: This involves the imprinting of signs/numbers/letters on the body or ears of animals and rubbing the imprinted marks with dye or paints to bring them out clearly for easy identification. (vi) Creep feeding: This is the placement of more nutritious feed for young animals out of the reach of their mothers in a compartment within the same pen called cribs for good growth and early weaning.</p><p>(b) Signs of heat in animals: (1) Restlessness (2) Mucus discharge from vulva.

(3) Moderate/Ideal temperature makes them to spread evenly and feed well. (4) High temperature makes chicks to pant and move away and sit with their mouth open. (5) Low temperature leads to hurdling together which may lead to suffocation and death. (6) High temperature, leads to poor feather development. (7) High temperature leads to pecking. (8) Greater susceptibility to diseases at both high and low temperature conditions. (9) Both high and low temperature lead to retarded growth.

(6) High temperature can reduce sexual activities in farm animal.</p><p>(c) Milk production: (1) Milk spoilage occurs at a temperature of 37°C. (2) Pathogenic bacteria in milk are destroyed when milk is subjected to a high temperature of about 74°C (pasteurisation). (3) High temperature causes heat stress thus reducing milk production. (4) Extremes of temperature affect feed intake leading to low milk production. (5) Physiological processes are retarded at extremes of temperature leading to low milk production.</p><p>(d) Egg production: (1) High temperature causes heat stress thus reducing the egg production (2) Low temperature leads to decrease in feed efficiency leading to a low egg production.

        "answer": "<p>(a) Explanation of the law of diminishing returns: (i) The law of diminishing returns states that as successive amounts of a variable factor are applied to one or more fixed factors, output will increase a lot at first but there comes a point at which the use of one more amount of the variable factor will add less to output than the preceding amount. That is the point where diminishing returns sets in. (ii) How the law of diminishing returns affects agricultural production: It enables farmers to determine/know the optimum level of combination of factors of production that will maximize output and profit.</p><p>(b) How some factors affect the supply of agricultural produce (i) Price: (a) The higher the price of the produce, the greater will be the supply. (b) The higher the supply of the produce, the lower will be the price.</p><p>(ii) Technology: (a) The development of new method of production which brings about increased output at lower cost leads to increase in supply. (b) The use of obsolete technology lowers production and thus reduces supply.</p><p>(iii) Weather: (a) In good weather there is abundant rainfalls and sunshine which favours agricultural production thereby increases supply. (b) Bad weather conditions such as drought, hurricanes etc affect agricultural production and lowers supply.</p><p>(iv) Subsidy: (a) Subsidy which is a non-repayable grant given to farmers in kind or cash helps to reduce the overall cost of production and encourages the farmers to produce more. (b) It enables the farmers to acquire farm inputs at lower prices thus enabling them to increase their production and supply.</p><p>(v) Government policy: (a) Taxes on agricultural inputs by the government increase the cost of production and this will cause a reduction in the supply of farm produce and vice versa. (b) A ban on importation of competitive produce will encourage local production thereby increasing supply and vice-versa.
