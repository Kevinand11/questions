This in turn reduces the amount of food output available to buyers.</p><p>(vi) Inadequate processing industries in the country has also hampered agricultural development, Such processing industries are rather expensive to set up and therefore not within reach of individual farmers</p><p>(vii) Inadequate storage and processing facilities will also force farmers to sell their produce at relatively cheaper rates In subsequent years, they become discouraged and therefore cut down on their output. The aggregate effect of this, is that there will be a general scarcity of certain food items during certain period of the year. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Write short notes on each of the following: (a) tractors; (b) incubators; (c) sprayers, (d) shelters</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Short Note on: (a) Tractors are two or four wheeled machines with rubber tyres or tracks (crawlers). They are equipped with a governor system and a power take off (P. T. O) shaft. It also has an hydraulic control system with lifts mounted implements under the control of the operator. There are also specially designed hitch bars which farm implements can be attached or detached from easily. They can be driven either with a diesel as a machinery or as a power source for equipment such as shelters, threshers, grinders etc. They are also used for or bush clearing and application of insecticides to the farm. The use of tractors can lead to increase in the profit of the farm, production, improved quality of produces as well as farm expansion. However, tractors are expensive to procure.</p><p>(b) Incubator is an equipment or a room used for hatching fertilized poultry eggs which requires an ideal temperature of about 39°C to hatch. They are made in varying sizes and designs and different types of fuel are used to supply the heat required. Examples of incubators are natural draught or table type and forced draught or cabinet type. Incubator requires adequate ventilation and it is filled with trays on which eggs are placed. It also needs adequate control of relative humidity with appropriate devices and adequate provision for turning eggs.</p><p>(c) Sprayer is made up of a tank, a pump and a spray nozzle. It may be tractor coupled or manually operated and is used to spray both herbicides, pesticides and liquid fertilizer. Sprayers are made of plastic, steel or galvanized Iron. Examples of sprayers include hand spray gun and knapsack sprayers, motorised and boom or electrodial.</p><p>(d) Shelters are used to separate the seeds from the husk or cob. Different types are made to suit the type of crop to be shelled, e.g. maize, groundnuts and cowpeas. It may be mechanically, electrically or manually operated. It is commonly' made up of a hopper, bucket, and a drum with rubber or metal spikes <br>\n </p>",

When plants and animals die, they undergo a process known as ammonisation. This is an enzymatic digestion which changes organic matter or proteins into complex amino acids. These amino acids will undergo another stage in the cycle known as ammonification. which involves the breaking down of complex amino acid into ammonia nitrogens. Some of this ammonia nitrogen may be used up directly by plants or by microorganism for humus formation and Amino acid ammonification R-OH-NI-1%. The remaining ammonia nitrogen then undergoes the third stage called nitrification which is an oxidative process where ammonial nitrogen is converted to nitrite with the help of two specific bacteria in nitrosomones and nitroecoccus.</p><p>The nitrite so formed undergoes further oxidative process, changing to nitrate with the help of the bacterium, Nitrobacter. Plants then absorb the nitrate and once more use it to build up plant protein. Animals which eat the plant die later and decay to add back organic matter to the soil. Some bacteria the soil take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to nitrate ready for plant use. Some are the symbiotic Rhizobiun) spp, which live in the root nodules of legumes.They fix large quantities of Nitrogen.</p><p>Some non-symbiotc bacteria also exist-Azo tobecter and clostridium live freely in the soil and fix atmospheric Nitrogen into the soil. Nitrogen is also fixed through lightening during rain storm Atmospheric nitrogen combines with oxygen during lightening to form nitric oxide and the nitric oxide is oxidised to form nitrogen dioxide by atmospheric oxygen, Nitrogen dioxide then dissolves in rain water to form nitrous acid and nitric acid. Nitrous acid is quickly oxidised and washed down the soil.</p><p>The nitrates so formed from these processes are changed back to atmospheric nitrogen by denitrifying bacteria. Some of the nitrates are lost through leaching and erosion. This process of addition and removal of nitrogen ensures balance in nature.</p>",
