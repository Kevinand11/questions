        "question": "<p>Discuss eight problems of agricultural development in Nigeria and suggest one possible solution to each of the problems</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The problems of agricultural development in Nigeria and one possible solution each are</p><p>(i) Inadequate land: The type of land tenure system, increasing population in Nigeria and deforestation do not make land available for agriculture. Solution: The government should implement the land use decree of 1978</p><p>(ii) Poor storage and processing facilities: These facilities are inadequate, costly, scarce and these eventually reduce the quality and quantity of agricultural produce. Solution: Government should provide storage and processing facilities at subsidised rate.</p><p>(iii) Lack of finance: Farmers do not have access to loan. They lack collateral security and the interest rate is very high. These prevent development of agriculture. Solution: Interest rate charged by banks should be reduced so that farmers can borrow money.</p><p>(iv) Inadequate farm input: Farm inputs are also scarce, inadequate, expensive and most farmers lack the technical know - how to operate them hence low agricultural procutivity. Solution: Government should reduce the cost of of farm inputs.</p><p>(v) Poor transportation Network; Most farms are not easily accessible; roads are bad coupled with lack of vehicles and high cost of transportation and these hinder agricultural development. Solution: Government Should construct good roads in rural areas</p><p>(vi) Lack of basic amenities: Social amenities like electricity, pipe borne water, health care services etc are lacking in rural areas and these affect agricultural production. Solution: Government through DFRRI should provide these amenities in rural areas.</p><p>(vii) Inadequate agricultural education and extension services: Most farmers are illiterate, conservative and crude. Extension officers are inadequate and inefficient hence, low agricultural productivity. Solution: Mass literacy campaign should be launched where farmers can be trained in modern method of farming.</p><p>(viii) Poor marketing system: There is no organised marketing system for farm produce. Produce are sold immediately after harvesting. Solution: Government agencies should buy produce from farmers and store for future consumption.</p>",
