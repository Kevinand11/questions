Disadvantages: (1) Mechanization may be difficult. (2) Non-members of the community may not have access to the use of the land.</p><p>(ii) Land tenure by Inheritance: This is a situation where land is inherited from one's parents. Disadvantage: It leads to land fragmentation</p><p>(iii) Lease hold system: This requires the payment of a fee or tenancy for land used over a stated period of time.
