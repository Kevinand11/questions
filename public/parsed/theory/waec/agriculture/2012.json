        "answer": "<p>10(a) Law of diminishing returns in agricultural production: The law states that, as successive amounts of a variable factor are applied to one or more fixed factors, output might increase a lot at first but there comes a point at which the use of more amount of the variable factor will add less to output than the preceding amount.</p><p>(b)(i) Input and Output graph of the relationships between fertilizer input and sorghum yield. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan1%2810%29.jpg\" style=\"height:326px; width:335px\"></p><p>(ii) Explanation of the relationships between fertilizer input and sorghum yield: As successive amounts of fertilizer are applied, sorghum yield increases proportionately until it got to a point at which the use of more amount of fertilizer added leads to less yield of sorghum than the preceding amount. </p><p>(c) Functions of agricultural extension agent: (i)Acts as a channel or link of communication between farmers/government/research stations. (ii) Helps to mobilize rural people. (iii) Operates as an agent of change by creating awareness of agricultural innovations. (iv) Helps to generate a new sense of fundamental re-orientation. (v) Designs, prepares for and executes training and demonstration programmes. (vi) Disseminates information and ideas to farmers. (vii) Advises and assists farmers to source for and obtain loans. (viii) Acts as a guidance and counsellor. (ix) Acts as a public relations officer to government/ research stations. </p><p>(d) Benefits of commodity boards in the marketing of agricultural produce in West Africa: (i) Provide ready market for various agricultural commodities. (ii) Help to eliminate the range of differences in prices between farmers and consumers. (iii) Prepare farmers' mind for what is due them financially by announcing guarantee prices of their commodities. (iv) Help to increase volume of production by farmers. (v) Offer technical advice to farmers on the use of farm inputs, etc, (vi) The pricing policies of commodity (marketing) boards make farmers income stable. (vii) Provide transportation services which help in evacuation of farm produce. (viii) Save farmers the rigour of exporting their produce. (ix) Perform marketing functions and services such as processing, storage, transportation, grading and packaging. (x) Sometimes settle disputes among farmers. (xi) Grant scholarships to farmers' children. (xii) Provide credits and subsidies to farmers. (xiii) Provide inputs to farmers. <br>\n </p>",
