(iii) improper storage and processing reduce the quantity and quality of the produce.</p><p>(3) Inadequate finance: (i) Peasant farmers have no access to loan or credit facilities, (iii) High interest rate charge by banks discourage borrowing. (di) Poor farmers who manage to get loans divert them to other purposes</p><p>(4) Inadequate transportation: (i) most farms in Nigeria are not accessible by roads. (ii) Lack of sufficient vehicle  hinders movement of food from rural to urban areas, (iii) High cost of transportation is a problem to commercial farming\" (Iv) Some of the existing roads in rural areas are in very bad condition.</p><p>(5) Lack of farm input: (i) Farm inputs like tools, fertilizers are inadequate. (ii) Farm inputs are of inferior quality. (iii) Farm inputs even wh-en available are not supplied to farmers at the right time,</p><p>(6) Lack of basic amenities; Basic amenities like, electricity, pipe borne water and hospitals are tacking in rural areas</p><p>(7) Inadequate agricultural education and extension services: (i) Majority of the farmers cannot read and 'write (ii) They do not know how to apply modern farm inputs (iii) Extension officers are inadequate.</p><p>(8) Poor marketing system: (i) There are no organised marketing channels for produce.

        "answer": "<p>Mechanization in Agriclture simply means the use of modern farm inputs to increase productivity and efficiency. It also involves the use of motorised equipments like tractors, planters, farm implements like plough, harrow, ridgers etc and also the use of chemicals, improved seeds and fertilizers to increase production.</p><p>Advantages of mechanization are (i) Mechanization increases production (ii) It reduces health hazards (iii) it supplements human power for heavy duty job (iv) There is timeliness in farm operation. (v) It encourages large scale farming (vi) It makes naturally difficult and unpleasent manual jobs, easy and pleasant</p><p>Disadvantages of mechanization are (i) Displacement of workers (ii) Destruction of soil structure (iii) It causes environmental pollution (iv) There is compaction of soil by machines</p><p>Limitations of agricultural mechanization are (i) Economic Limitation: farmers are generally poor. They do not have money to buy inputs like tractors, fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, etc (ii) Technical know-how: Most farmers do not know how to operate machines or apply fertilizers. They do not read instructions attached to the implements. (iii) small holdings of of farmlands: Most farmers cultivate small farmlands because they are poor and as a result of thetype of land tenure system practiced in Nigeria (iv) Lack of maintenance: Farmers cannot repair farm tools and implements. Spare parts are scarce, expensive with no trained personnel to repair machines.</p><p> </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The process of egg formation in poultry is controlled by hormones. The egg is formed partly in the ovary and partly the oviduct. Yolk is formed In the ovary while other proteinous parts are formed in the liver and kidney. The yolk released by the ovary is taken up by infidibuIum and later moved to the oviduct where fertilization takes place The egg moves to the magnum, stay there for three hours and part of the albumen is formed. Chalaza is secreted round the yolk from the magnum. the egg moves to the isthmus where it stays for 1¼ hours and the two shell membrane, are formed. The shape of the egg is also formed in this region. The egg then, moves to the uterus where it slays for 19-20 hours, The Shell is formed in the uterus. The egg is then passed to the vagina where it stays for a very short time before it is laid</p><p>Six functions/roles of the reproductive hormones in animals are: (i) Androgen stimulates the development of  male secondary sexual characters and sex behaviours. (ii) It stimulates the optimum condition for spern production (iii) estrogen helps in the production of heat in fernales. (iv) It also regulates menstrual cycle and ovulation (v) progesterone helps in the continuance of pregnancy (vi) Oxytocin helps in causing milk production.</p>",
