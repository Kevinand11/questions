        "answer": "<p>A. How God changed a formless earth to a place of life and activity (Genesis 1:1-31):</p><p>i. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</p><p>ii. The earth was formless, and the spirit of God hovered on the face of the waters.</p><p>iii. God commanded the light to appear on the formless, empty, and dark earth.</p><p>iv. He then separated the light from the darkness and called the light day and the darkness níght.</p><p>v. Again, God made the expanse and separated the waters under the expanse from the water above and called it sky.</p><p>vi. The water below the expanse was then gathered to one place to create dry ground.</p><p>vii. The dry ground God called land and the gathered water, seas.</p><p>viii. God then caused the land to produce vegetation of plants bearing seeds according to their kind and trees bearing fruits.</p><p>ix. Further, God created the seasons, days and years, and lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.</p><p>x. God made two great lights- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night.</p><p>xi. This was followed by the creation of the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing.</p><p>xii. Every winged bird according to its kind was also created to fly across the expanse of the sky.</p><p>xiii. The creatures of the sea and the birds were commanded to increase in number to fill the water in the sea and the earth respectively.</p><p>xiv. Liveştock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals were also created.</p><p>xv. God then created man in His own image and likeness to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and all creatures.</p><p>xvi. God blessed the man and woman to be fruitful and increase in number to fill the earth and subdue it.</p><p> </p><p>B Ways humans are destroying God's creation:</p><p>i. legal mining/galamsey/sand mining.</p><p>ii Overgrazing.</p><p>iii Pollution -water, air, and noise.</p><p>iv. Indiscriminate waste disposal.</p><p>v. Over-exploitation of natural resources/ deforestation/overfishing/overhunting.</p><p>vi. Genetic engineering (cloning).</p><p>vi.

        "answer": "<p>A. God's instructions to Joshua on his assumption of leadership over lsrael (Numbers 27:15-23;Joshua 1:1-9): .</p><p>i When Moses was about to exit the leadership position of lsrael, he prayed to God to appoint his Successor in order not to leave the people like sheep without a shepherd.</p><p>ii, So, the Lord ordered Moses to take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit and lay hand on him.</p><p>iii. Joshua was to be brought before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly to be commissioned.</p><p>iv. Moses did as was commanded by the Lord and Joshua was brought before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly who commissioned and laid hand on him.</p><p>V. God then promised to give Joshua every place that the sole of his feet would tread.</p><p>vi. The territory extending from the desert to Lebanon and from the great river, Euphrates to the Great Sea.</p><p>vi. The Lord promised to be with Joshua as He was with Moses.</p><p>vii. And no one would be able to stand against him all the days of his life.</p><p>ix. Joshua was to be strong and courageous as he would lead the Israelites to inherit the land promised their forefathers.</p><p>x. He was to be careful to obey all the law Moses gave him to be successful wherever he went.</p><p>xi. Joshua was to make sure the book of the law never departed from his mouth but to meditate upon it day and night.</p><p>xii. He was to apply the law in everything to be prosperous and successful</p><p>xiii. Joshua was to be courageous and strong and not to be terrified or discouraged, for the Lord would be with him wherever he went.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>B Lessons political leaders can learn from Joshua's experience:</p><p>1. Political leaders should not impose successors but allow God to lead in making such a choice</p><p>ii. They should help the people to elect leaders who are goal-oriented and people-oriented</p><p>iii Political leaders should know when enough is enough and retire honourably</p><p>iv. They should be interested in grooming people who can take over from them.</p><p>v Like Moses, they should show confidence in the authority and abilities of their successors to rule</p><p>vi. They must be confident that they can only succeed when they observe God's prescriptions</p><p>vii Political leaders should be patient as they wait to assume leadership positions and not take power through evil manipulations or by force of arms</p><p>viii Political leaders should be courageous and obedient in all they do</p>",

        "answer": "<p>A How David resisted taking Saul's life at the wilderness of Ziph (1 Samuel 26:1-25):</p><p>i Saul received a report from the Ziphites that David was hiding on the hill of Hachilah</p><p>ii So, Saul went in search of David at the Desert of Ziph with three thousand chosen men</p><p>iii Saul and his men made their camp beside the road on the hill of Hachilah facing Jeshimon whilst David stayed in the desert</p><p>iv. When David heard of the presence of Saul, he sent men to scout the whereabouts of Saul and this was confirmed.</p><p>v. With this information. David and Abishai went to the camp of Saul and saw him and Abner, the commander of the army lying down sleeping with the army encamped around them</p><p>vi. Abishai said to David that the Lord had delivered his enemy into head and that David should allow him to kill Saul.</p><p>vii. David rebuked Abishai because it is a sin to kill the lords anointed.</p><p>viii. David again said that Saul should be allowed to die in the hands of the Lord or in battle but not in his hand / the life of Saul was in God's hands.</p><p>ix., David then ordered Sauľ's spear that was stuck to the ground near his head and his water jar to be taken away</p><p>x. When David crossed to the other side, he called to Saul and his men saying they had failed to protect the King and that Abner, the Army Commander deserved to die</p><p>Xi. Saul then called out to David and he responded by asking why Saul was pursuing him and what his guilt was.</p><p>xii. David, however, said if it was the Lord's doing; then He should accept an offering but if it were men. they must be cursed before the Lord.</p><p>xiii. David wondered why the king of Israel should be hunting him like a partridge in the mountain.</p><p>xiv. Saul apologized to David and promised not to harm him because he had spared his life.</p><p>xV. David handed over Saul's spear and water jug to him and noted that the Lord rewards everyone for his/her righteousness and faithfulness.</p><p>xvi. David ended by saying that the Lord had delivered Saul into his hand but he would not lay hands on the Lord's anointed.</p><p>xvii. Because I valued your life, may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all troubles.</p><p>xviii, Saul blessed David and they both departed.</p><p> </p><p>B. Benefits of self-control:</p><p>i. It is a sign of maturity/principled.</p><p>ii. it fosters harmonious living with others.</p><p>iii. It prevents reckless talks and actions/avoidance of temptation.</p><p>iv. It ensures well-thought out decisions.</p><p>v. It accords oneself respect and respect for others.</p><p>vi. It ensures peaceful resolution of disputes.</p><p>vii.

Solomon acknowledged that like the earth and heaven, the Temple could not contain the Lord.</p><p>vi. He, however, appealed to the Lord to have mercy and hear his cry and prayer in His presence.</p><p>vii. Solomon requested of the Lord to open His eyes towards the Temple day and night so that He would hear the prayer of His servants towards this place.</p><p>viii. When a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath before your altar in this Temple, hear from heaven and act</p><p>ix. Judge between servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on his own head what he has done/declare the innocent not guilty, and so establish his innocence.</p><p>x. When Israel is defeated at war due to sin against you but they confess to your name in the Temple, bring them again to the land of their forefathers,</p><p>xi. If there is drought or famine due to sins of your people and they turn to you in supplication in the Temple, give them rain.</p><p>xii. In times of disaster or disease, when the people pray with hands towards the Temple, forgive and deliver them.</p><p>xiii. When a foreigner hears of your name and comes to pray towards the Temple, grant his request so that all the people of the earth would know you.</p><p>xiv.
