The descent of the spirit on Jesus was a symbol of Him being anointed as son of God/ being confirmed as the Messiah.</p><p>xii. . Jesus underwent baptism in order to identify with sinners whom He came to redeem.</p><p>xiii. The Holy Spirit which came upon Jesus led and guided Him to do God's will.</p><p>xiv.

They answered, it concerned Jesus. a great prophet that was mighty in words and deeds;</p><p>vi And how the Jewish council had delivered him to be condemned to death</p><p>vii, He was the one they had hoped would redeem Israel.</p><p>viii. It was then the third day since it happened - though some of their women had amazed them with the story of his resurrection.</p><p>ix. Some of their men had however been to the tomb and found it empty as the women had told them/but Jesus they did not see.</p><p>x. Jesus called them fools who were slow of heart to believe all that the. prophets had spoken.</p><p>xi. He said that, it was necessary that Christ should suffer and enter into glory.</p><p>xii. Beginning with Moses and the prophets, he interpreted to them all that the scriptures had spoken about himself.</p><p>xiii. When they drew near the village, Jesus made as though he would go further they pleaded with him to pass the night with them (for the day was spent).</p><p>xiv. He went in with them and, at table; he took the bread, blessed and broke it.</p><p>xv. And their eyes were Opened and they recognized that it was Jesus.</p><p>xvi.

James outlined the fact that a person gains no profit by merely claiming to have faith but not works.</p><p>ii. Genuine faith is evidenced by works. He called on Christians to be doers of the word and not deceive themselves as men of faith, by not doing what they professed.</p><p>iii. Thus faith without works is dead.</p><p>iv. Faith is expressed in practical works like charity/caring for the sick, widows,</p><p>v. Faith and works are inseparable for, you cannot show me your faith with,</p><p>vi A person is justified by works and not by faith alone For works is the finality of it</p><p>vii. James taught that people who have belief in God without expressing it in actions justify their faith are not different from the devil,.</p><p>viii For the devil also believes in God but does not do God's work</p><p>ix. James argued that if Christians are mere hearers, they are like a man who observe his face in a mirror, but as soon as he goes away, forgets what his face looks like.</p><p>x. For somebody to be truly 'religious he must bridle his tongue, or else his religion is in vain! he is deceiving himself.</p><p>xi. James argues further that Abraham was justified by works when he was ready to offer his son Isaac. Thus he justified his faith by works.</p><p>xii. Again, Rahab the harlot was also justified by her works when she protected the spies sent by Joshua. She had faith in God and matched it by saving the spies.</p><p>xiii. These two people expressed their faiths by their deeds.</p><p>xiv. Faith and works are essential to each other just as the body arid the spirit.</p><p>xv. Thus, just as the body apart from the spirit is dead, faith apart from works is dead.</p><p> </p><p>B) EXPRESSION OF FAITH IN WORKS.</p><p>i Respecting themselves service to the society/country/charity.</p><p>ii. Loving one another / being hospitable.</p><p>iii. Being law abiding.</p><p>iv. Performing one's civic responsibilities and religious obligations.</p><p>v.
