        "question": "<p>(a) Describe how Deborah led her people to victory.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention three ways by which women today are contributing towards national development.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Israel played harlotry against God, thus the Lord sold them to king Jabin of Canaan to attack them as a punishment. Canaan punished Israel for a period of 40 years. Then Israel repented and cried to God for help. Deborah, a prophetess and wife of Lappidoth was called by God to deliver Israel. To do this, Deborah summoned Barak to raise an army of 10,000 against Jabin's army led by Sisera. Barak insisted that he would not go unless Deborah went with him. Deborah consented, but warned that the Lord would sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. Deborah arose and went with Barak to the battle front to ensure God's presence and victory. When Sisera was told that Barak had gone up to mount Tabor, he advanced with his army to attack him. Deborah ordered Barak to launch an attack on Sisera and Sisera and his army were routed. Sisera escaped and took refuge in the house of Jael where he was murdered.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways by which women can contribute to national development include:</p><p>(i) Women take part in politics and formation of government policies.</p><p>(ii) Women contribute to government's various programmes for rural and urban women, e.g. Better Life For Rural Women, Family Support Programme, etc.</p><p>(iii) Women take part in business and economic development.</p><p>(iv) Enlightened women demonstrate equal abilities with men in education, law, politics, transportation, etc.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Give an account of the division of the kingdom of Israel.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What unwise policies of Solomon led to it? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) After the death of Solomon, Rehoboam went to Schechem for his coronation. At this time, Northern Israel was under the leadership of Jeroboam who came and said to Rehoboam, \"your father made our yoke heavy. Therefore, lighten the hard service of your father and we will serve you\". Rehoboam requested that they should give him three days and come back thereafter. Rehoboam took counsel with his father's advisers who told him to hearken to the people's request, but he did not take to the advice of the elders. Rather he listened to the advice of his age mates who advised him to even increase the burden of the people. Jeroboam and all the people of Israel came to Rehoboam on the third day and the king spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men. Israel then reacted, \"What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse, to your tents 0 Israel.\" Israel then departed to their tents and Rehoboam reigned over Judah.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Solomon's unwise policies which led to the division of the kingdom were:</p><p>(1) Solomon's imposition of heavy tax</p><p>(2) Solomon's introduction of hard labour</p><p>(3) Solomon's marriage to foreign women and their gods.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the story of Daniel in which his faith was put to test.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two suggestions would you give to a present-day priest who faces opposition in his work of evangelization</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Daniel was one of the three presidents appointed by king Dairus to govern the 120 satraps of his empire. He found favour with the king and was to be made the administrative officer, a prestigious position which was envied by the other presidents. His rivals persuaded the king to sign into law an irrevocable decree that any one, except the king, who made a petition to a god or man for a period of thirty days would be thrown into a lion's den. Despite the decree, Daniel went to the upper chamber of his house, left the windows open and prayed to his God three times daily. He was maliciously accused and reported to the king by the conspirators for failure to obey the decree. He was brought before the king, tried and was ordered to be cast into the lion's den.</p><p>While Daniel was in the lion's den, Darius fervently prayed for his safety. Darius ordered a stone to be laid upon the entrance of the den and sealed it with his signet. He became downcast throughout the time Daniel remained in the den. Early in the morning of the following day, he went to the lion's den and cried out to Daniel to knoW whether or not he had been saved by his God. When he realized Daniel was still alive, with great joy, he ordered him to be brought out. He commanded his false accusers and their families to be thrown into the den of lions. He issued a decree which enjoined everybody in his domain to worship the God of Daniel.</p><p> </p><p>(b) For a present day priest who faces opposition in his work of evangelization, it is advisable that the church should:</p><p>(i) embark on prayer and fasting for God's spiritual support and strengthening of faith.</p><p>(ii) advise him to continue to grow in faith</p><p>(iii) If opposition borders on threat to his life, he should appeal to the authorities in the land</p><p>(iv) Priests are to maintain personal and moral integrity.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the story of the healing of the leper and indicate the significance of the instructions given by Jesus.</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways does God still perform miracles today?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) A leper knelt before Jesus and besought him to heal him. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying, \"be clean\". Immediately, the leper was healed; he became clean. Then Jesus warned him not to tell anybody or spread the news, but to go to the priest and offer, for his cleansing, what Moses commanded as a proof to the people. But he went out and began to spread the news such that the crowd that gathered around Jesus made it difficult for him to enter openly into the town. Jesus remained in the countryside where people came to him from all over the place.</p><p>The significance of the instructions given to the cleansed leper by Jesus were:</p><p>(i) Jesus wanted to keep his messiahship secret because it was yet too early to expose himself as, he needed some time for his teaching to permeate people's hearts to enable them fully appreciate the true meaning of his messiahship through his death on the cross and salvation for man.</p><p>(ii) Again, his teaching ministry was of greater importance than his healing ministry. Hence, if those healed were to spread the news about their healing, the crowd that would come for similar healings would disturb his teaching ministry.</p><p>(iii) Jesus obeyed the Mosaic law, especially as it was in accordance with God's law of mercy and kindness. It was also the role of priests to declare a leper clean, to make him acceptable in society. Jesus' concern for the sick made him advise the healed leper to do everything to remove the stigma of ostracism he had suffered froth for so long.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Some ways by which God performs miracles today include:</p><p>(i) God continues to perform miracles of healing through doctors, nurses, surgeons, etc:</p><p>(ii) Many Christians have been healed because of their faith. This is the belief of many churches today.</p><p>(iii) In miraculous ways, sinners have been converted to saints or believers with the local churches as agents of Christ.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) John was baptising at the river Jordan when Jesus came to him. John identified Jesus as the Lamb of God who was to take away the sins of the world. John confessed that Jesus was greater than him for he (Jesus) had existed before him At first, John did not know Jesus, but he came baptising with water that Jesus might be revealed. The spirit of the Lord had told John that he would identify Jesus as the man on whom the spirit would descend. At the baptism of Jesus, the spirit descended as a dove from heaven and rested on him . John bore witness that Jesus is the son of God. </p><p> </p><p>(b) The significance of Jesus' baptism to Christians include:</p><p>(i) As the Lamb of God, his crucifixion takes away man's sin by faith.</p><p>(ii) Having accepted this, we must turn away from our sins.</p><p>(iii) We have to bear testimony, that is, spread this happy news to others who have not known him.</p><p>(iv) Jesus is the final sacrifice.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) In his defence before the Jewish council, Stephen went on to say that they also resisted the Holy Spirit because their fathers persecuted the prophets and they too were doing same. Their fathers persecuted those who foretold the coming of the righteous one whom they had murdered. They had received the law of God which they had not kept. This accusation angered them, so they ground their teeth against Stephen. But soon, Stephen gazed into heaven and announced that he saw Jesus sitting at the right, hand of God. Because of this, they could no longer bear it; they rushed upon him and dragged him out of the city. As they were stoning him, he prayed to God for their forgiveness, for they did not know what they were doing. While this was going on, Saul, who later became Paul, bore witness. He kept their clothes and gave his approval to it all.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Stephen's trial was of significance to the early church in the following ways:</p><p>(i) It led to the evangelisation outside Jerusalem.</p><p>(ii) Stephen's death led to great persecution in Jerusalem.</p><p>(iii) The stoning of Stephen helped to introduce Saul who later became Paul the apostle to the Gentiles.</p><p>(iv) Saul led the persecution of the church.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Explain what Paul called Spiritual Gifts in 1 Corinthians and how he likened them to the human body.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What is the significance of this teaching to the Church?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)  According to Paul, spiritual gifts are gifts from the Lord. Their genuineness can be tested when the beneficiary confesses \"Jesus is Lord\", but if by the devil, he says \"Jesus is cursed\". There are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspired them all in every one. Paul then enumerated nine spiritual gifts. These are utterance of wisdom, utterance of knowledge, faith, healing power, miracle working, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues.</p><p>Paul compares these gifts with the human body with its different members, each playing an important role for the good of the entire body. No part can say that since it is not the other member, it does not belong to the body, for if the whole body were to be an eye, where would be the ear? Or if the whole body is an ear, where then would be the nose? God has so arranged the individual parts that they are mutually interdependent and necessary for their corporate existence. Infact, some weaker parts are crowned with greater respectability to avoid discord in the body for if one member suffers, the entire body suffers and if one member is honoured, all rejoice together.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The significance of Paul's teaching to the church includes:</p><p>(i) Since the human body is one, so are we who have been baptised by one spirit into the body of Christ. The church acts and behaves as one united by the church.</p><p>(ii) In the church, there should be no discrimination of people's contributions in the over all good of the church.</p><p>(iii) No member should feel proud for his talent or contribution in the over all good of the church.</p><p>(iv) There should be no racial discrimination in the church; no Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo or lgbira. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul advises the Thessalonians to keep away from an idle brother, one who is not behaving in accordance with the tradition he had set up for them. He taught them to imitate his life of industry. While he, was with them he ate nobody's food without paying for it. Rather, he worked tirelessly for his daily needs. This he did, not because he had no right to depend upon his preaching, but to leave them with conduct worthy of emulation. He had earlier given them the command, \"If anyone will not work, let him not eat,\" but he had heard that some of them were living in idleness. He, however exhorted such fellows to do their work quietly to earn their living. If at the end, any of them still refused to obey his instruction, he should be ostracised to make him feel ashamed. They should not, however, regard such fellow as enemy but only warn him as a brother.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways by which Christians should uphold this teaching are:</p><p>(1) We should be proud of our job.</p><p>(ii) Dignity of labour should be emphasized.</p><p>(iii) Christians should not be beggars or extortionists.</p><p>(iv) Christians should not be lazy, rather they should be gainfully employed.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe how Paul dealt with the problem of the Corinthian Christians who did not believe in ressurection.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What is the significance of the ressurection of Christ to Christians?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul wrote to the Corinthians to counter the wrong teaching imparted to them. In the first place, he reminded them about his early teaching on the subject which they accepted and hoped would give them justification and salvation if they continued in true faith in Christ. Paul told them that he delivered the doctrine of resurrection to them as he received it; that Jesus died for their sins, was buried and has risen on the third day according to the scriptures. As proofs of his resurrection, he appeared to his disciples including Peter, James and five hundred others. Lastly, he appeared to him Paul, the least of the apostles, being a persecutor of the church. He wondered why some unbelievers should deny the resurrection of Christ if there were such abundant and clear evidence to prove it.</p><p>Paul averred that Jesus could not have been raised if there was no resurrection and, if he was not raised, then his preachings and those of others would have been in vain. This means that preachers would be guilty of deception and misrepresentation of God. These would render their faith useless and make them remain in sins. If Jesus did not resurrect, then the dead in Christ remain perished and those who are still alive with faith in Christ stand to be pitied. But the fact remains that Christ has been raised from the dead and has become the first fruit among those who have fallen asleep. Paul stated further that death first came through the first Adam, so also life after death has come to man through Jesus Christ. God has put every thing under Christ's authority and through his grace, Christians are assured of life eternal.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The significance of resurrection of Jesus to Christians are:</p><p>(i) Victory over death has been won for the children of God by Jesus.</p><p>(ii) Death for a Christian is only the gate-way to eternal life in the kingdom of God for all believers.</p><p>(iii) By raising Jesus from the dead, God has shown the world that Jesus is His son. </p>",
