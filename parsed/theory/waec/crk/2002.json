        "question": "<p>Identify Joseph's talents and show how he applied them as a leader. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Joseph was one of the exceptional leaders in the history of the Israelites. He had some talents which he put to use every leadership position he found himself (Gen.37:1-28, 41:1-57; 45:1-15). Joseph was loved by his father more than any of his eleven brethren and he always reported his brothers' misdeeds to their father. He was also a dreamer and had 3 gift of vision. He narrated his dreams to his brothers and to his father. Because of this, his father reprimanded him and his brothers hated him. As an obedient and faithful child, his father sent him to see to the welfare of his brethren who :onspired on sighting him from afar and sold him into slavery, thereby attempting to frustrate God's plan for him.</p><p>As a slave in Egypt, God equipped him with the gifts of endurance and faith. He knew what was right and avoided all forms of immorality. Even when he was imprisoned unjustly, he endured all the suffering and became a trusted friend to his fellow :risoners.</p><p>He interpreted the dreams of his fellow prisoners. The chief butler proved ungrateful to. Joseph for two years he did  nothing to help him. Afterwards Pharaoh had dreams which Joseph later interpreted. From prison, he was elevated and appointed as Governor of Egypt and was given unlimited powers. He showed excellent management ability as governor.</p><p>His humility and love made him keep a level head, even when his brethren, who no longer recognized him, came to buy corn in Egypt. Through a number of tests, he got them to confess their past guilt and misdeeds or wrongdoing. Like a true Bader, he forgave them and reconciled with them. Finally, he sent for his father and ensured that he lived his final days in peace.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Zedekiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar sent troops against Jerusalem. The siege lasted for nineteen months and the resultant 'amine forced the king to attempt to escape from the doomed city by night. He was overtaken, captured and sentenced. His sons were executed before his very eyes and was blinded and taken in fetters to Babylon. Later, Nebusaradan (the captain of the body guard or a servant of the king of Babylon) came to Jerusalem with instruction to destroy the city. He burnt the temple, the king's house and every great house. The wall round Jerusalem was also broken down. Many more Israelites were taken to Babylon leaving only the poorest of the land to be vine dressers and ploughmen. The last traces of the splendour of Solomon were also taken as booty to Babylon</p><p> </p><p>(b) The causes of social unrest in Africa today are:</p><p>(i) Political instability</p><p>(ii) economic stagnation</p><p>(iii) social injustice</p><p>(iv) suppression of truth</p><p>(v) desire of a group to dominate others politically</p><p>(vi) widening the gap between the rich and the poor</p><p>(vii) religious fanaticism</p><p>(viii) corruption and dishonesty</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Relate the story of the healing of Naaman.</p><p> </p><p>(b) How was the name of God glorified through his misfortune? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Naaman was commander of the Syrian Army he was a leper. A slave girl suggested that if he would go to Samaria, 3 prophet would heal him. He took a letter from the king of Syria to the king of Israel telling him that he was sent by his commander to him to be healed of leprosy. When the king of Israel received the letter, he rent his clothes and said \"Am God, to kill or make alive, that this man sent word to cure a man of leprosy\"</p><p>When prophet Elisha heard that the king had rent his clothes, he intervened and asked that Naaman be sent to him. He said, \"let him now come to me that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel'. Naaman went to Elisha and was 'old to go and wash himself seven times in the River Jordan and be cured of the disease.</p><p>He was annoyed over Elisha's advice, and asked if \"rivers Abana and Pharpar of Damascus were not better than all -le waters of Israel? \"Could I not wash in them and be clean\" He turned his chariot to return to Damascus in great rage. However, on his way, his servants humbly entreated him to return and comply with the prophet's instructions. Naaman fielded and went to River Jordan, dipped himself seven times into it, and became clean. He returned to Elisha to show its gratitude and begged him to accept some of his precious gifts but Elisha refused.</p><p>Then, Naaman pleaded to be allowed to carry home to Damascus a small quantity of earth from Israel and put it in 3 corner of his house to signify that henceforth, he would serve the God of Israel.</p><p> </p><p>(b) God's name was glorified through his misfortune in the following ways:</p><p>(i) His healing shows that the God of Israel is the only true God.</p><p>(ii) It also Chows that God through the prophet of Israel had powers to perform healing miracles.</p><p>(iii) Elishas's refusal to accept le gifts shows that God's given talents are free and should not be seen as commodities for sale.</p><p>(iv) Naaman's servant convinced him to be humble and obedient to the prophet of God and this shows that God can choose to use anybody, no matter his or her position in life, to manifest His glory.</p><p>(v) Naaman's healing led to the worshipping of Yahweh in a non-Israelite territory.</p><p>(vi) Obedience to the word of God spoken by His true prophets is important if one wants to receive from God.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) There was general oppression of the poor by the wealthy. The wealthy sold the righteous for silver and the needy for pair of shoes. The poor had no fair trial in the courts and the level of prostitution was so high that a man and his father could go into the same woman. At the altar, the rich men sat in clothes given as pledge to them by their poor debtors and they also drank at the altars, wine of those who had been fined. Their women fed fat on the proceeds of their husband's oppression of the poor and drank wines from bowls. Amos referred to these people as cows of Bashan.</p><p>The rich built stone houses and lived in great luxury with proceeds derived from their cheating of the poor. In the markets, the rich used false weight and measures. In spite of various forms of punishment such as famine, drought, blight and mildew, locust infestation and all the curses of Egypt, slaughter of their young men in battles, depopulation e.t.c., they still persisted in evil and refused to listen to the voice of God but desired the Day of the Lord.' Amos warned :hem and said they should be prepared for total doom that would come from God's wrath.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Vices condemned by Amos which are still prevalent in our society today are:</p><p>(i) Oppression of the poor by the wealthy: Low wages are paid to the poor for services rendered to their masters or employers.</p><p>(ii) Injustice in the courts: The rich accused bribe their way in the courts and the poor rarely receive just judgement.</p><p>(iii)Cheating in business: Some rich and influential businessmen have perfected the art of edging or pushing the poor out of business.</p><p>(iv)Luxury: With much of the national revenue in the hands of a rich few who daily become richer at the expense of the poor, the rich build palaces and own expensive limousines and enjoy all forms of luxury at the expense of the poor</p>",

        "answer": "<p>After his baptism, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. He fasted for forty days and nights and at the end of the fasting, he was very hungry. The devil came and told him that if he were the son of God, he should turn the stones into bread. He replied that it was written that 'man shall not live by bread alone devil then took him to the pinnacle of the temple and said to him 'if you are the son of God, throw yourself down, for it written, \"He will give his angels charge of you,\" and Jesus replied him that 'again it is written, 'You shall not tempt Lord your God,\" After this, the devil took him to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory and, said to him \"All these I will give to you if you will fall down and worship me.\" Jesus said to him, 'Begone, Satan! For it is written, \"You shall worship the Lord your God...\" Immediately the devil left him and angels came and ministered him. </p><p>The significance of the temptations to Jesus in his ministry are: (i) The temptation confirmed the divinity of Christ. (ii) Through the temptations, Jesus accepted suffering as a means of achieving God's purpose which was the redemption of man. (iii) With his victory over Satan, Jesus assured his followers that, with the word of God, they too could overcome the wiles of the devil. (iv) The temptations signaled the preparation of Jesus for his ministry. (v) The way Jesus hand the temptations show that Jesus is not a political or economic messiah.</p>",

After collecting his share, he left his home town and spent it lavishly in loose living. A great famine arose in the country made him to be in want and he was forced to descend to the most degrading employment of tend swine. He later came back to his senses and resolved to return to his father and tell him not to accept him as a son but a hired servant. While he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and ran and embraced him.</p><p>The son humbly pleaded with his father to take him back simply as a slave not as a son. However, the servants were ordered to clothe the son the best robe fitting for the guest of honour, give him the ring (of authority) and the shoes (of freedom) and then slay fattened calf so that all might share in the father's gladness. So, the son was restored to his former position and tthe began to make merry. The elder one came, heard the sound of the celebration and when he made inquiries, the servant told him that \"Your brother has come and your father is making merriment for him\" The elder brother was indifferent would not come in until his father came and entreated him.

Jesus told her that it was a pity that she did not know the person that was asking her for a drink. He said, if she had known, she would have asked him for living water. The Samaritan wondered how he could provide water without a vessel to get the water from such a deep well.</p><p>She said she was sure, he could not be greater than Jacob, the great grand father of the Israelites who gave them the well which Jacob himself and all descendants and their animals drank from. Jesus said emphatically that whoever drank of the water that he would give would never thirst again, for the water he would give would become a spring of water to eternal life.

        "answer": "<p>(a) Saul, a persecutor of the Church asked the high Priest for letters of introduction to the synagogues at Damascus so that if he found any one belonging to the way, he could arrest and bring him to Jerusalem. As he approached Damascus, he saw a great light, fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, \"Saul, Saul, why you persecute, me?\" \"Who are you Lord\", Saul asked and the voice replied, \"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. Immediately, he became blind and was led to Damascus, where he remained without food for three days. In Damascus, there was a disciple called Ananias who was sent by God to the house of Judas in Straight street enquire of Saul of Tarsus.</p><p>The Lord said that Saul was praying and in a vision, he had seen Ananias laying his hands him, so that he might receive his sight. But Ananias protested saying that he had heard from many about \" this man how much evil he had done to the saints at Jerusalem, and how he got authority from the chief priests to bind all who came upon thy name.\"But, the Lord described Saul as a chosen instrument to carry the name of Jesus to the Gentiles and Kings and the Sons of lsrael. Ananias obeyed the Lord and came to Saul and, addressing him as \"brother Saul\", he told him that the Lord Jesus who appeared to him on the road had sent him that Saul might regain his sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes and he regained his sight.

        "answer": "<p>One of the major themes dealt with by Paul in his letters was the second coming of Jesus Christ. He spoke of imminence of the great occasion and the need for Christians to lead a good life in readiness for Jesus at his second coming. Some Thessalonian Christians were led to the misconception that the Parousia was just around the corner. They felt there was, therefore, no need for them to exert themselves in further physical work, what mattered was to watch and pray. When Paul received the news that some Thessalonians had folded their hands and refused to work and that they had even constituted themselves into a nuisance for the others, by either preventing them from their work or by solely depending on them for their bread, he had to write to them in very strong terms in order to disabuse the minds of such lazy people. Paul said categorically that whoever refuses to work should not eat.</p><p>People should honestly help themselves to work, without eye-service, as if they were serving the Lord. He reminded them that when he was with them he was not parasitic, although he had the right to depend on them for his physical needs. He had worked with his own hands in order to maintain himself and be, for them, an exam worthy of emulation. It was therefore compulsory for the lazy to get down to work with their hands. But should they not heed his advice they should be boycotted to their shame. However, he warned that they should not be treated as enemies, but warned and re-directed with brotherly love, to retrace their steps and do the right thing. </p>",

He said He who now restrains it, will do so until He is out of the way and then the lawless one whose coming, by the activity of Satan, will be with power, pretension, signs, wonder and wicked deception, will be revealed.

He appeared to Cephas and the twelve and later to more than five hundred brethren at one time, some of which were still alive while some had fallen asleep. Then, he appeared to James and all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to Paul who being the least of the apostles was unfit to be called an apostle because he had persecuted the church of God.</p><p>(ii) The grace of God towards Paul made him what he was for Christ and such grace was not in vain. It made Paul to work harder than any of those who received Christ before him.</p><p>(iii) If there was no resurrection, it meant that Christ had not been raised and the apostolic preaching and the Christian faith should have been in vain for the apostles must have been misrepresenting God who they preached had raised Christ from the dead.</p><p>(iv) If Christ had not been raised, then their faith was futile.
