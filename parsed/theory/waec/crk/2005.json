        "question": "<p>(a) Give an account of the war between the Israelites and the Canaanites during the time of Deborah</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what three ways can Christians benefit from the leadership qualities displayed by Deborah?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The war between the Israelites and the Canaanites during the time of Deborah started when Israel cried to the Lord following the oppression that came from the Canaanites. God raised Deborah, a prophetess, who following God's instructions, summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh. When Barak arrived, Deborah informed him that the Lord God of Israel had commanded him to gather at Mount Tabor ten thousand men from the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali. She added that God had promised to draw Sisera (the general of the army of King Jabin of Canaan), to meet Barak by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops. Deborah concluded by confirming that God would give victory to Barak. Barak insisted that he would go to battle on the condition that Deborah went with him. Deborah agreed to go with Barak, pointing out that the glory of victory would not go to Barak but to a woman chosen by God. Barak summoned his army — ten thousand men and Deborah went up with him to Mount Tabor.</p><p>On hearing that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, Sisera called up his men to war against Barak and Deborah. Deborah ordered Barak, \"up! For this is the day the Lord has given Sisera in to your hand\". In response, Barak went down with his army against Sisera and the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots / army before Barak. Sisera, having lost his entire army, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber, who offered him hospitality. While Sisera slept, Jael drove a tent peg into his temple and he died.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways Christians can benefit from Deborah's leadership qualities are:</p><p>(i) Deborah was courageous and intelligent: This can be seen in the manner she handled the affairs of the war. She convinced Barak to obey God's command and eventually humiliated the Canaanite army.</p><p>(ii) Deborah was obedient and humble: She responded to God's call. She allowed God to use her as an instrument of victory hence she did not complain when God sent her to Barak / she trusted in God.</p><p>(iii) She motivated Barak to go to war by agreeing to go with him. She served as a source of motivation / inspiration.</p><p>(iv) Deborah proved that God can use a woman as an instrument.</p><p>(v) Patriotism — Deborah demonstrated patriotism by fighting for her nation. She defended the territorial integrity of Israel.</p><p>(vi) Deborah proved that the feminine gender is no handicap in accomplishing onerous tasks — what matters is the determination</p>",

God is not an author of confusion. He clarifies issues for the sake of his words.</p><p>(iii) God is interested in the leadership of his people / God enthrones.

        "answer": "<p>(a)The following led to Naaman's healing:</p><p>(i) Naaman was a Syrian commander with leprosy. A little girl from the land of Israel who was living with Naaman's mistress told her about the prophet in Israel, who could cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman informed the king of Syrian, who gave him a letter to the king of Israel. He went to Israel with the letter and lots of expensive presents. He gave the letter to the king of Israel, who rent his clothes after reading and asked if he was God who could kill and keep alive. He became afraid, thinking that the king of Syria was looking for a way to attack him. Elisha, the man of God heard the news and sent for Naaman. As Naaman stepped at the door, Elisha sent his messenger to tell Naaman to go and wash himself seven times in River Jordan. At first, he hesitated, but was later persuaded by his servant to heed the instruction. He obeyed and went to River Jordan and dipped himself seven times in the river and was healed.</p><p>(ii) Naaman reaction to his healing was that he returned to the man of God and offered some gifts which were rejected.</p><p>(iii) The incident that followed this reaction was that he asked for Israelite soil to be taken to Syria for the worship of God. Gehazi, Elisha's servant went after Naaman and took some of the gifts which his master rejected. Elisha cursed him and he became a leper.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The virtues and lessons that can be learnt from the entire episode are:</p><p>(i) God's blessings and healing are free of charge. </p><p>(ii) It pays to obey men of God and the fact that everyone is important in the society. The information that proved vital to Naaman came from a little maid.</p><p>(iii) God does not always work in the way man thinks. He works in mysterious way, that man can not comprehend. With God all things are possible. Everything obeys God's will. People should be humble in their dealings with fellow men. This is the only way to obey God's injunction on humility. God is the God of both the rich and the poor. There is no discrimination based on wealth or class. God sees everybody as equal for Him. It pays to be honest, for honesty is a virtue loved by God. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) (i) The names of Hosea's three children were Jezreel, Not Pitied (La Ruhamah) and Not my People (Lo-Ammi)</p><p>(ii) The first son was named Jezreel, symbolizing that God was going to punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel (and put an end to the kingdom of Israel). The second was named 'Not Pitied', meaning that the Lord would no longer love or have pity on the house of Israel because of their sins. The third child 'Not my People', meaning that the people of Israel were no longer regarded as God's people, neither would God be their God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Names are significant in our society, through the following ways: The name of a child indicates the circumstances surrounding the birth. Names point to the position I title held by parents at the time of birth. Names point to the desire of parents — what they want their children to be. Names are given in remembrance of the ancestors. Names determine the position of the child in the family. In commemoration of important events in the family I village. Names indicate ethnic I tribal I religious identity.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>The parable of Lazarus and the rich man goes like this: There was a rich man who wore robes befitting an elevated status and feasted sumptuously daily. At his gate laid a poor man named Lazarus who was full of sores. He ate the crumbs from the table and dogs licked his sores. When Lazarus died, he was laid in the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died, but was in hade being in torment. He saw Abraham far off with Lazarus on his bosom and called for help (water to cool his tongue). Abraham reminded him of his affluent position in the world and the extreme poverty of Lazarus, Moreover, there was a gulf / gap that separated them. He begged Abraham to send Lazarus back to his five brothers on earth so that they too would not languish in hell fire. By saying that, the teaching of Moses and the prophets should be.enough guide to them. Abraham replied him. The rich man persisted that if a man from the dead went to them, they would repent. Abraham replied again that if they failed to listen to Moses and the prophets, they would not be convinced if a man from the dead visited them.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways in which Christians can use their wealth for the benefit of the society are:</p><p>(i) In showing mercy to those in need (the poor, beggars and destitute).</p><p>(ii) As donations at any Christian launching (building of a church, launching Christian books, etc).</p><p>(iii) In propagating the gospel (gift items to the preachers, such as public address system, microphones, etc).</p><p>(iv) Embarking on social projects beneficial to mankind.</p><p>(v) Sponsoring religious organizations. </p>",

Jesus made no answer to the accusation of the chief Priest and Elders. Pilate asked Jesus if he did not hear all the allegations leveled against him by the people. Pilate wondered greatly at Jesus' silence in the face of mounting allegations.</p><p>There was a custom at the Passover for the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd. Meanwhile, there was a notorious thief called Barabbas. Pilate asked the crowd to chose between Jesus and Barabbas. Pilate knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered Jesus up. Pilate's wife sent word to him, warning him that he should have nothing to do with the righteous Jesus.</p><p>The chief Priest and the Elders persuaded people to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. Pilate asked the crowd which of the two should be released to them and they all chose Barabbas. Pilate asked what to do with Jesus and they replied that he should be crucified. Pilate demanded from them the reason for crucifying Jesus. He then washed his hands with water and declared his innocence of Jesus' blood (see to it yourself). The people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children\". Pilate released Barabbas, scourged Jesus and released him to be crucified.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways in which people are denied justice in the society are:</p><p>(i) Hiring of false witnesses.</p><p>(ii) Adjournment: Delay of trial and judgment.</p><p>(iii) Bribery: Judges demand and take bribes.</p><p>(iv) Falsification of evidence.</p><p>(v) Failure to release judgement as and when due.</p><p>(vi) Rigging of elections.</p><p>(vii) Nepotism / Tribalism, etc</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) The circumstances were that when Saul, the unbeliever who persecuted the Christians, collected letters of introduction to synagogues in Damascus, to enable him arrest Christians in the city. He planned to bring the arrested Christians / believers bound to Jerusalem for persecution. As he approached Damascus, a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard the quoted voice. After hearing the voice, Paul then asked, \"who are you Lord\" and the voice replied, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Rise and enter the city and you would be told what to do. The man who were traveling with him stood speechless hearing voices, but seeing no one. He discovered he was blind and was led by hand into Damascus.</p><p>For three days, he neither ate nor drank. Meanwhile, the Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision to go to the house of Judas (in Straight Street) and ask for Saul of Tarsus. Ananias was further told that Saul had, while praying, seen him in a vision laying hands on him so that he might regain his sight. But Ananias protested and explained that he had heard a great deal about Saul's persecution of Christians in Jerusalem,  and that he had actually come to Damascus with the aim of binding believers. The Lord insisted that Ananias should go to Saul whom the Lord said He had chosen as an instrument for the proclamation of the Gospel. The Lord promised to show Saul, how much suffering he would undergo for the Lord's sake. Ananias therefore went to Saul and informed him that the Lord who appeared to him on the way to Damascus, had sent him to him, that he might regain his sight. Immediately, something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then Saul arose and was baptized.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways in which this experience affected Saul's life are:</p><p>(i) Saul was transformed from being a persecutor of the Christians to a defender of Christianity.</p><p>(ii) It also changed him from its former devotion to the Law, to a complete devotion to Jesus Christ.</p><p>(iii) Paul became an apostle to the Gentiles and from there, the early church enjoyed peace. As the Lord predicted, Saul endured untold persecution in his efforts to propagate the gospel. </p>",

Paul reminds the Romans that though they are many, yet they are one body in Christ. People should not be arrogant because of their talents. Individually, they are members of one another, so individual talents should be used to help one another. Though, gifts may differ according to the grace given to them, they must use the gifts for the benefit of the community / church. The person who has the gift of prophecy should use it in proportion to his faith, while those who serve should serve faithfully, Those who teach or exhort should do so faithfully and effectively, for the benefit of the church. He who contributes, should do so liberally, while he who gives aid, must do so with zeal.

Therefore, believers should be prepared at all times. As children of the day / light, believers should be on guard and not asleep as others. Since believers live in the light / sins of the day, they should be sober and awake. Believers should put on their breastplate of faith and love, they should increase their faith in the Lord as they wait for the Second Coming of Christ. The hope of salvation should motivate every Christian to prepare for the Lord's coming. This is because the Lord has decided to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ and not to destroy us in His anger. Christ died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might be with him in the hereafter / eternally. Christians are to encourage one another and to build one another up explaining why preparations should be made for the second coming.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Significance of the Second Coming;</p><p>(i) The second coming is a time when God will intervene directly and dramatically in world affairs.</p><p>(ii) The day of punishment for sinners and reward for faithful believers.</p><p>(iii) The day Christ will judge sinners and set up his eternal kingdom.</p><p>(iv) The day God will defeat all the forces of evil.</p>",
