        "answer": "<p>(a) God gave Joshua a master plan for the capture of Jericho which was strictly adhered to by him. The assault started with a procession led by armed men of war, followed by seven priests with seven trumpets, while another group of priests formed the rear guard bearing the ark of the Lord, and simultaneously the trumpets blew continually as the procession marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days. After each march, they came into the camp and spent the night there. There, they were warned not to shout until Joshua gave them the order to shout. On the seventh lay, they rose early and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. At the seventh time, when the priest had blown the trumpet, Joshua commanded the people to shout, adding that the Lord had given them the city. Immediately, people shouted and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the trumpet, they raised a great shout and the wall fell down flat. The people went straight into the city and took it. Joshua then instructed the people to destroy the city with fire and this was done. But Rahab, the harlot who spared the two spies, together with her household, were not destroyed. Also precious stones like gold silver and the vessels of bronze were kept in the Lord's treasury.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons for Christians to Learn</p><p>(i) The Omnipotence / power of God was demonstrated / with God everything is possible, nothing is beyond God's power.</p><p>(ii) God is ready to fight for His people, if we trust in Him at all time. he emphasis is on trust.</p><p>(iii) Joshua is presented as a man of Faith in God. He did not doubt God.</p><p>(iv) Obedience: Joshua obeyed God's command. This led to his success.</p><p>(v) God uses people no matter their conditions (e.g. Ahab, the harlot) <br>\n<br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What circumstances led to the rejection of Saul as king over Israel?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Mention three lessons that can be learnt from this rejection. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Saul was made a king over Israel by Samuel and was told to hearken to the words of the Lord. The Lord made it known to him that He was going to punish the Amalekites for their opposition to the Israelites on their way from Egypt to Canaan and Saul was instructed to destroy the Amalekites and not to spare them but to kill both men and women, infants and suckling, oxen and sheep. In obedience to God's command, Saul and his army came to Amalek; laid in wait in the valley. He advised the Kenites who showed kindness to the Israelites to depart from the Amalekites to avoid being destroyed. The Kenites obeyed and departed from the Amalekites.</p><p>Saul then defeated the Amalekites in a battle and spared Agag, their king against God's express command. He spared the best of the sheep, oxen, and all that were good, he only destroyed only what was worthless and despised. Saul defended himself rather weakly by stating that he spared the best of the sheep to offer sacrifice to God / He shifted the blame on the people. Samuel decried Saul's action and denounced his non-performance of the commandments given to him by God / to obey is better than sacrifice. For this act of disobedience, he was rejected by God. As Samuel turned to go away from Saul, he held Samuel's skirt and it got torn. Samuel then declared that as Saul had torn his robe, the Lord had torn the kingdom of Israel and had given it to his neighbour.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons from Saul's Experience:</p><p>(i) Disobedience leads to suffering and condemnation from God. Saul suffered greatly. God allowed evil spirit to torment him.</p><p>(ii) Disobedience can lead to a tragic end. Saul lost his life along with his three sons in a battle,</p><p>(iii) One man's disobedience can lead to the suffering of the whole nation as seen in Saul's.</p><p>(iv) God's plan for our lives can be distorted through disobedience.</p><p>(v) Obedience is better than sacrifice.</p><p>(vi) The need to accept responsibility for our actions rather than blaming others.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) After Shaphan had read the contents of the Book of the Law to king Josiah, the king rent his cloths as a measure of his sadness over the long neglect of the book. He then sent emissaries to enquire of the Lord for him and for all Israel, concerning the words of the book, adding that the wrath of God was great against them because their fathers had not obeyed the words of the book. After hearing from the prophetess, Josiah gathered everybody to Jerusalem (men and women, the old and the young) and the book was read to the hearing of all.

        "answer": "<p>(a) Ezekiel saw God in His great glory and fell down upon his face. There and then the spirit (of God) entered into him and set him upon his feet. A voice told him that he was being sent to the people of Israel-a nation of rebels — they and their fathers had been unfaithful to God. The Israelites were impudent / stubborn, but he should speak to them. With God's authority, he should tell them: \"Thus says the Lord God ...' Whether they would hear or not, they would know that a prophet had risen among them. As for Ezekiel himself he must not be afraid of them / their words. Though they were briers / thorns / scorpions, he must not rebel like them. (He was then ordered to open his mouth and eat what was offered him) and a scroll was given to him to eat. He ate it, and it tasted like honey. God reminded Ezekiel that though, the people of Israel were stubborn and hard-hearted, He had made Ezekiel's face harder than those of the Israelites. God assured him that though the people of Israel were stubborn and hard-hearted, He had made Ezekiel's face harder than those of the Israelites. Ezekiel should not be dismayed by their looks, but should receive all the words / instructions of God in his heart / with his ears. He should then get to the exiles and prophesy to them.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons from Ezekiel's experiences.</p><p>(i) God commissions people for service.</p><p>(ii) God equips man for service. God does not send without equipment</p><p>(iii) God can make use of anyone no matter his background.</p><p>(iv) The message from God must be digested / clearly understood at the time of the commissioning.</p><p>(v) The message must be delivered no matter the level of opposition / confrontation.</p><p>(vi) God's word is delightful.</p>",

        "question": "<p> (a) Outline the Lukan account of the birth of Jesus.</p><p> </p><p>(b) What two lessons can be learnt from the circumstances of Jesus' birth? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Mary, a virgin, was betrothed to a man named Joseph. The angel of the Lord had told Mary that she would bear a son whose name would be Jesus. The angel explained that the Holy Spirit would come upon Mary and that the power of the Most High would overshadow her. The child to be born would be called holy, the Son of God. Soon after the encounter Mary was conceived of the Holy Spirit. When the time for her to be delivered approached, Joseph went with her down to Bethlehem in Judea. This was because Caesar Augustus had ordered that everybody should go to his town for a census. Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem, the city of David for the census, because they were of that lineage. As there was no place in the Inn, Mary gave birth to a baby boy in a manger. Mary wrapped the child in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger. The shepherds were told about the birth of Jesus in the city of David by the angels. just as the heavenly Host glorified God: Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased. And they went to see the child and everything was as the angel said. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons:</p><p>(i) One important lesson is that the humble nature of one's birth does not affect one's greatness in life,</p><p>(ii) With God, all things are possible. Mary, a virgin, was conceived of the Holy Spirit which in human perspectives would have been impossible.</p><p>(iii) We should take our civic responsibility seriously. Joseph carried out his civic responsibility by taking Mary to Bethlehem in deference to the Roman authorities concerning census. God can use people of humble birth to achieve His purposes</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) Adultery and Divorce: Moses' law decreed that one should not commit adultery but Jesus Christ has now expounded the scope to include lustful look which now attracts the same consequences as the actual deed of adultery. Jesus teaches that one should not allow one's eye to lead one to sin; it is better to lose it than go into hell fire with the whole body. Jesus teaches that if it is the right hand, (useful as it is) that causes one to sin, cut if off and throw it away. A body with a hand is better than the whole body in hell fire. Mosaic Law states that he who divorced his wife should give her a certificate of divorce, but Jesus ordered that no one should divorce his wife except on the ground of unchastity. Jesus regards marriage involving a divorcee as adultery.</p><p>(ii) Neighbours and Enemies: Jesus commanded that we should seek the welfare of our enemies and pray for them. (We should not love only our neighbours and hate our enemies), insisting that those who practice this would be called the sons of the Father. Our Father allows the sun to shine on both the good and the wicked / the rain falls on both the just and the unjust. He maintains that If we love only those who love us, we have no reward and If we salute I greet only our brothers, we are still like the unbelievers, we should rather strive for perfection. We must be perfect as our heavenly Father is.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons:</p><p>(i) One lesson is the introduction of a new dimension to adultery; lust, has been raised — it is as serious as the act itself and must be avoided.</p><p>(ii) Another is that divorce should have no place in marriage. The issue of chastity in marriage must be adhered to. This is another major lesson. And finally any obstacle to our entry into the kingdom must be avoided at all cost.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How did Jesus describe himself as the 'Door' and the 'Good Shepherd'?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways is this teaching relevant to Christians?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Jesus teaches that He is the Good Shepherd and that the Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep explaining that any one who does not enter the sheep-fold by the door but climbs by another way is a thief, but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. Thus, Jesus describes himself as the door and concludes that any one that enters by him at any time will be saved. The gatekeeper opens the door to him and the sheep hear his voice and he calls them by name. He leads the sheep out and the sheep follow him (because they know him and his voice). The sheep will not follow a stranger as they do not know his voice. Christ says that as the Shepherd, he will not flee at the sight of a wolf as a hireling will. Jesus says, he cares for his sheep for they belong to him. The thief / wolf destroys but Jesus gives abundant life.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Relevance to Christians By laying down his life for us, Christ has opened the door to eternal life for everybody that believes and does the will of God. We must recognize Jesus as the only door through which we can enter into a life of happiness / joy. Any other door will mean destruction. If Christ has died for us, we should sin no more. We should always listen to the right voice, the voice of God and follow it. We should be steadfast in serving the Lord, not counting the loss. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) The believers' communal living was such that the Christians shared their possessions in common. Ananias and Sapphira sold their own piece of land, but brought only a part of the money to the Church. This was strictly against the spirit of communal life of the Christians. Peter asked Ananias why satan had led him to lie to the Holy Spirit, telling him that the land and the proceeds were theirs and they were free to handle them the way they wished. But by declaring publicly that they were handing over the entire proceeds, they had not lied to man but to God. When Ananias heard these words of rebuke from Peter, he fell down and died. Young men later carried away his body for burial. His wife / Sapphira came in, unaware of what had happened to her husband. Peter asked her whether they had sold the land for the amount surrendered, she affirmed it. Peter asked her why she conspired with her husband to tempt the spirit of God telling her to listen to the approaching footsteps of those who had gone to bury her husband: Immediately she heard this she fell down and died. Her body was carried away by the same young men who had earlier carried her husband for burial. Great fear came upon the Church and upon all who heard the news.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons: Ananias and Sapphira were misguided into thinking that they could serve both God and Mammon at the same time. One can deceive a fellow man, but cannot deceive God who reads the heart of man. The Church was established by God and controlled by the Holy Spirit. Members must work in accordance with guidelines set up by the Holy Spirit. God punishes sin of disobedience and His judgment is certain. We should give with sincerity / honesty.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul admonished all Christians to be subject to the governing authorities stressing that there is no authority except those from God. All existing authorities are instituted by God and to resist them therefore is to resist God. Such resistance definitely will earn God's wrath / judgment. According to Paul, rulers are not terrors to a good conduct, but to bad one. Good citizens should not exercise undue fear about those in authority as long as they obey the rules I and conduct themselves well. If they do what is right; they would receive commendation of the governing authority, for they are God's servants. On the other hand, if they do any wrong they should be afraid and be prepared for the consequence / i.e. God's wrath on wrong doers. Therefore, to live like good citizens, they should always do what is right to satisfy their conscience. and they should pay their taxes as and when due. He enjoined the citizens to give respect to constituted authorities and honour their rulers.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Ways to Manifest qualities of Good Citizenship.</p><p>(i) By making no derogatory statements against their rulers/ heads.</p><p>(ii) Expressing grievances through constitutional means/dialogue and not through violent demonstrations.</p><p>(iii) Shunning membership of secret societies.</p><p>(iv) Taking part in public enlightenment/campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, communicable diseases, child abuse, hard drug peddling, bribery and corruption, etc in the society/serving as a role model to others. </p>",

Paul reminded the Thessalonians that he and his men did not eat anyone's food / bread without paying for it. \"We toiled and laboured day and night that we might not burden any of you\". \"We had the right but we only wanted to give you an example to copy\". He reminded them of the command which they (Paul and his men) gave them: when they were with them 'if any one will not work, let him not eat'. Paul and his men were surprised that in spite of this command, they still heard that some of them were living in idleness, becoming mere busy-bodies. He advised that such a person should be warned as a brother and not as an enemy. Such people should do their work and earn their own living.</p><p> </p><p>(b) How the Church can uphold the teaching today and eliminate idleness in the Society?</p><p>(i) Trainning of inmates of orphanages.</p><p>(ii) Establishing printing presses, bookshops and some other opportunities, etc.</p><p>(iii) Preaching against idleness.</p><p>(iv) Establishment of schools, hospitals, vocational centres for giving education to children and people generally.</p><p>(v) Some churches have farm settlements, where people are trained for farm work. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) James emphasized the role of faith in producing effective prayer. He taught believers not to doubt when they pray. He compared any one that doubts with a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. According to him, a double-minded person, unstable in all his ways, will not receive anything from God through prayer. James confirmed that God answers prayers generously and will grant wisdom to anyone who asks for it in prayer. He taught that prayer can remove suffering and sickness of sin. James advised that elders of the Church should be called upon to pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord or the prayer of faith will save the sickman. Believers should confess their sins to one another and pray for one anther in order to attract God's healing and forgiveness of sin. James advised people who are cheerful to sing praises to God i.e. worship God in prayer. The prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects / clean heart, clean soul. He illustrated with the prayer of Elijah who prayed fervently that it might not rain; and for 31/2 years, it did not rain. He prayed again and the heavens gave rain.</p><p> </p><p>b) Hindrances to effective prayer.</p><p>(i) Our prayers will not be answered if they are not according to the will of God.</p><p>(ii) Prayers said thoughtlessly may not be answered.</p><p>(iii) If we pray without faith, our prayers may not be answered.</p><p>(iv) The presence of sin in our lives can lead to unanswered prayers / non-confession of sins.</p><p>(v) We should not serve two Gods — God and mammon.</p><p>(vi) Prayers from unforgiving hearts are usually not answered.</p><p>(vii) Lack of perseverance.

        "question": "<p>How did James prove that 'faith apart from works is dead'? <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>a) James taught that men of faith should do what they profess. For if they are mere hearers, they are like a man who observes his face in a mirror but soon forgets the image of his face. He asserted that God's blessings come through works and not faith. It is no profit if an ill-clad brother or sister who goes without food is admonished to go in peace without giving any assistance. He taught that faith and works should be inseparable; otherwise, faith is barren. He linked faith with true religion which involves visiting orphans / widows in their afflictions. Keeping away from the stain of sin / the world. It is not enough to believe in God because demons also believe in God and tremble. James cited Biblical instances of faith and works operating in unison. Abraham was justified not merely for his faith but for preparedness to sacrifice his son, Isaac. He was therefore, justified by works and faith and not by faith alone. Abraham believed God, acted on that faith and it was reckoned for him as righteousness. Consequently, he was called the friend of God. In the same way, Rahab, the harlot, was justified by works when she received God's / Joshua's messengers and sent them out safely after securing their lives. <br>\n </p>",
