        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the story of the second creation as contained in Genesis chapter 2.</p><p> </p><p>(b) How does this story illustrate the sovereignty of God?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)  After God had completed the creation of heaven and earth, there was neither man nor plant or any other living creature to live on earth. There was no rain to water the earth except the dew that came from heaven. God formed man out of the dust of the earth and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils. Man immediately became a living being. God made a garden in Eden and commanded the man to take charge over it.</p><p>There were trees ( both the trees of knowledge and evil) which God planted in the garden. Four rivers namely Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates which flowed out to wet the garden divided the garden into four. God commanded man to eat of every tree of the garden, but the tree of knowledge of good and evil, man should not eat. If man should eat of the forbidden tree, that means disobedience and the consequence of it would be death. God saw that man was lonely in the garden and He (God ) decided to make a partner for him. He caused a deep sleep to befall man and He (God) took a rib out of him and used it to make woman as a life partner for Adam. The woman was named Eve, for she was made out of man's rib. When Adam woke up and saw her, she said: \" This is the bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman because she was taken out of a man\".</p><p> </p><p>(b) From the story of the second creation in Genesis Chapter two, the sovereignty of God is revealed as follows:</p><p>(i) It portrays God as the creator of the heaven and earth.</p><p>(ii) God has every control over what He created.</p><p>(iii) God saw that it was not good for man to live alone, therefore, He made a helper for him.</p><p>(iv) The institution of marriage was established for the continuity of procreation. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Why did Elijah pronounce drought on lsreal and how did Ahab react to this?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What lessons about the supremacy of God do we learn from this event ? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) When Asa was thirty eight years on the throne at Judah, Ahab began to reign in Israel. Ahab married the daughter of Sidonian king called Jezebel. Because of this foreign woman whom Ahab married , he began to serve and worship baal. He built an altar for baal in Samaria and made an Asherah. During his reign as king, Ahab committed a lot of atrocities before God more than any other king that had lived and reigned before him. This made God to be annoyed.</p><p>As a result, God sent Elijah the prophet to warn him of his sins. There was a serious famine in the land of Samaria and as a result of the drought, Obadiah was sent by Ahab to look for springs of water and valleys for the animals so that they might not die. Ahab went to a different direction while Obadiah went on another in search of green pasture. In the process, Obadiah and Elijah met and Obadiah recognized Elijah. He bowed down at Elijah's feet and worshipped him. Elijah sent for Ahab. Obadiah delivered the message of Elijah to Ahab and Ahab appeared before Elijah and said: \" Is it you troubler of Israel?\" Elijah replied: \" I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father's house because you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and followed the baals\".</p><p> </p><p>(b) From the encounter, the supremacy of God can be established in the following ways:</p><p>(I) To show His supremacy, God withheld the rain from falling as a punishment for sin.</p><p>(ii) For the period that the drought lasted, God provided food and water for Elijah.</p><p>(iii) God protected those prophets that were loyal to Him in the land of Israel during the period of famine and drought.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Describe any three practices which Amos condemned in the religious life of Isreal and indicate the three things he recommended in their place. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>People trooped out every Sabbath and other ceremonial days to all the worshipping centres, e.g. Bethel, Dan, Gilgal and Bersheba to worship God falsely. Amos found out that their actions amounted to lip service owing to multiplication of sins and trangressions. This attitude, Amos condemned totally. Amos also frowned at the worshippers' attitude that the places which were supposed to be sacred were turned to where they shared clothes, take people's pledges and also for cult prostitution with the main aim to profane the name of God.</p><p>Amos also saw that the solemn assembly of the people was pretentious. They did this in order to practice the heathen orgies from foreign nations. They danced to the music of these foreign gods under the camouflage that they were worshipping true God. They made free will offerings and paid their tithes. These items were those that they got from the poor and because of that, God pronounced that He would no longer accept their (false) assemblies. All the holy days were no longer kept holy.</p><p>The Sabbath, the festival of the new moon and other holy days were no longer meant for such. Instead. the days had been turned to time of acquiring wealth and oppressing the poor. It was the wish of the people that the days were increased, so that they could acquire more wealth. Because they had made contact with foreign religion, they could not but swear in the names of the heathen gods. The Lord would definitely punish them for this sinful act since God could no longer tolerate it.</p><p> </p><p>Amos, considering the religious practices in Israel, made the following recommendations:</p><p>(i) They must come back to God in order to make national survival possible.</p><p>(ii) The people should do away with foreign religions and their practices which were not the ways of God.</p><p>(iii) The day of the Lord would be for them a day of gloom and darkness and not of glory if they failed to do the wishes of God.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James and John and led them up a high mountain where they were alone. He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun and his garments became white as light There appeared to them Moses and Elijah, who spoke with Jesus. Peter said: \" Lord it is well that we are here, if you wish, I will make three booths, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah\". While he was speaking, a bright cloud over-shadowed them and a voice from the cloud said, \" this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased; listen to him\". When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe. Jesus came and touched them, saying: \"Rise, and have no fear\". When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The significances of transfiguration of Christ to Christians include:</p><p>(i) The appearance of Moses and Elijah signified that Jesus came to fulfill the law and the prophets and not to cancel it.</p><p>(ii) It confirms Jesus as the true son of God.</p><p>(iii) The disappearance of Moses and Elijah signify that the law and the prophet had come to pass or had been replaced by a new fulfilled one in Jesus Christ who is the messiah.</p><p>(iv) The disciples of Jesus became stronger in the faith that Jesus was truly the son of God. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How does Jesus describe Himself in St John's Gospel as the Living Water ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what ways does this teaching apply to us? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) When Jesus was going to Galilee, he passed through Samaria. In Samaria, he met a Samaritan woman at the Jacob's well who came to fetch water . Jesus requested the woman to give him water to drink. The woman questioned why he (Jesus) a Jew, requested from her a Samaritan to give him water to drink. Jesus replied that if she knew the gift of God and who he was, that requested her to give him water to drink, she would have asked Him for a living water. In her reply, the woman said to Jesus that he (Jesus) did not have any container to draw the water with and she also asked where Jesus got that living water from. She further queried Jesus whether he was greater than their father Jacob who gave them the well and drank from it. Jesus said, \" Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never. The water I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life-. The Samaritan woman then asked Jesus Christ to give her the living water, so that she would neither be thirsty nor come to draw water again.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The story of the living water is applicable to the present day Christians in the following ways:</p><p>(i) The living water is used by Jesus as a figurative expression. The \"living water\" means the word of God.</p><p>(ii) It signifies that. to Jesus Christ, there is no discrimination among the Jews, Greeks and Gentiles.</p><p>(iii) The living water, which comes out from Jesus Christ is enough to sustain us in all situations in which we may find ourselves.</p><p>(iv) The living water from Jesus will lead us to heaven.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) Narrate the story of the conversion of Saul and show with two examples the effect of this conversion on the growth of the Church. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>After the death of Stephen, many Christians ran to Damascus for their dear lives. Saul was happy at the death of Stephen. He went from house to house persecuting those who belonged to the faith. Saul went to the high priest in Jerusalem to demand for a written permission to travel to Damascus and bring down to Jerusalem in chains those who proclaimed the resurrection of Jesus Christ. On his way, near Damascus. he met with Jesus Christ in a transforming vision. A light from heaven shone on him and he fell down as he heard a voice saying: \" Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\" When he asked whom he was persecuting, the voice said: \"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but rise and enter the city, and you would be told what to do\". In the city, there was a disciple by name Ananias who lived in a street named Straight, whom God had commissioned to restore Saul's sight. (Before this time, Saul had lived for three days without food). But Ananias told God that he had heard of Saul how he had caused havoc to those who belonged to the way and that the man, Saul was a dangerous person.</p><p>God assured him that He had made him a chosen instrument to preach and propagate the gospel, death and the resurrection of Jesus to the Jews and Gentiles and that since he had persecuted the church of God, he too would not go without being persecuted by Jesus. Ananias went as commanded by God and laid his hands on Saul. Something like scale fell from his eyes and he regained his sight and was baptised immediately. He was then given food to eat.</p><p> </p><p>The effect of this conversion on the growth of the church can be seen as</p><p>(i) Saul who persecuted the Christians (disciples) now became a major soul winner for the church.</p><p>(ii) It led to the expansion of the church.</p><p>(iii) Many people were converted to Christianity.</p><p>(iv) It led to the universality of the church. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) How did Paul differentiate between law and grace?</p><p> </p><p>(b) What is the significance of these two concepts in the life of a christian</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the world was not because of his obedience to the law, but as a result of his faith in God. The knowledge of the law leads to punishment. Without the law, there would be no sin. The promise to Abraham's heirs depends on faith and the promise, however, is not only for Abraham's descendants alone, but for all who believe by faith just as Abraham the father of the faithfuls whose faith in God was fully illustrate when he believed God's promise that he would be the father of all nations. Despite the old age of both Abraham and Sarah, Abraham did not doubt God's promise, but held on to the faith he had in God. Because of one man's disobedience, many became sinners and were condemned due to Adam's sin. By the grace of God through the righteousness in Jesus, mankind has been saved. Law came to multiply transgression, where sin increased, grace abounded.</p><p> </p><p>(b) The significance of law and grace in a Christians' life is that:</p><p>(i) If we obey the law, it would not lead to salvation. It is rather an end in itself but a means to an end.</p><p>(ii) It is the belief of the Christian that he had died to sin through his baptism a faith in Jesus.</p><p>(iii) Through God's grace, Christians would live eternally with Jesus in heaven.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What is Paul's teaching on the dignity of labour ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Give two reasons why we should respect individual professions. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul wrote to the Thessalonians on the dignity of labour. He rebuked and disowned those brothers in the church who lived in idleness for they were not living according to the laid down rules of the church. He encouraged them to imitate his exemplary life. He did not in any way like idleness, neither did he depend on their material support for living. He worked for his earning and paid for what he ate. Paul did not imply that anyone who work in the house of God should not be entitled to wages. He had to put teaching into practice by saying if anyone would not work, let him not eat.</p><p>Paul particularly mentioned those members whom he heard had refused to work but were relying on others. commanded them to do away with such habits. He finally warned that if any member should refuse to listen to instruction, such a member should be isolated. This would make him to be ashamed of himself with a view to thinking his actions. The church, Paul warned should not regard such members as enemies but they should be treated with all human sympathy.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Reasons why individual professions should be respected include:</p><p>(i) No particular job is indispensable.</p><p>(ii) All jobs are complementary.</p><p>(iii) We should not look at any job as menial.</p><p>(iv) We must work to earn a living for others to be encouraged by our example.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What is Paul's teaching on new life in Christ ?</p><p> </p><p>(b) In what two ways can Christians manifest this ? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Paul admonished that if one is raised with Christ, let him seek the things that are above, not the things that below for such a person has died and his life is hid in Christ. When Christ who is our life appears, then we will appear with him in glory, putting to death what is earthly such as fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, covetousness and idolatry. Paul enjoined us to put away anger, wrath, malice, slander and foul talk from our mouth. \"Do not lie to one another because you are now a new creation. There should be no discrimination of race in you, no Greek or Jew, free man or slave, circumcised, and uncircumcised, sex or creed, but Christ should be all in all\".</p><p>He also admonished that, \"You should put on compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, patience and forebearance towards one another. You should forgive one another as the Lord has forgiven you. You should show love, teaching and admonishing one another. You should sing songs of thanks and praises to God. Everything must be done in the name of God through Christ\".</p><p> </p><p>(b) Some ways by which Christians can manifest this are:</p><p>(i) Living a new life and forgetting the old.</p><p>(ii) As a Christian you should be a light and salt of the world.</p><p>(iii) You must involve yourself in the work of preaching the Gospel.</p>",
