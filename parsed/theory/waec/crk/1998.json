        "answer": "<p>(a) Moses was asked by God to go to the mount of Abarim where he would die on account of his rebellion in the Wilderness of Zin at the water of Meribah. He suggested to God that a worthy leader be appointed over Israel so that Israel would not be like sheep without a shepherd. The Lord commanded him to appoint Joshua to succeed him. He was asked to lay hands on him and cause him to stand before Eleazar the priest, who would inquire for him by the urim, and all the congregation before whom he should commission him as a leader. Moses was asked to invest him with some of his authorities so that the people of Israel would obey him. Moses did according to the words of God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Two previous association of Moses and Joshua were:</p><p>(i) When he (Moses) went for the ten commandments on mount Sinai.</p><p>(ii) Joshua was one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to spy the land of Canaan. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Narrate the first anointing of Saul by Samuel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>When Saul and Samuel were alone, Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on Saul's head. Samuel informed him that God had anointed him prince over his people and would save them from the hand of their enemies. To give confidence to the newly anointed that this was from the Lord, he was given some signs that:</p><p>(i) two men would meet him at Rachael's tomb with the news that the asses had been found and his father was now anxious about his safety.</p><p>(ii) Three men on their way to Bethel to worship would greet him and give him two wares.</p><p>(iii) At Gibeo, he would meet a herd of prophets and he would prophesy.</p><p>(iv) Finally, Saul was to go to Gibeo for seven days to wait for Samuel who would offer sacrifice there. These signs took place and when Saul prophesied, it attracted the comment of the people who asked \"Is Saul 71- also a prophet?\" At last, back home, Saul reported his search for the asses to his uncle but kept quiet over the matter of the anointing. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) God called Jonah and sent him to declare to the people of Nineveh that their wickedness had gone up before Him. Jonah tried to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, but Jonah's flight was cut short by a storm sent by the Lord from whom no one could escape. The mariners were afraid and each cried to his god and threw their wares in the ship into the sea to lighten it. Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and was fast asleep.</p><p>The captain of the ship challenged him for sleeping and for not calling on his God. They cast lot and it fell on Jonah. The captain questioned him over his action, nationality and calling and Jonah revealed that he was a Hebrew fleeing from the Lord. Jonah, at his request, was thrown into the sea. Already, God had appointed a great fish to swallow him up and he stayed in the fish's belly for three days and three nights. Jonah prayed to the Lord from the belly of the fish and the Lord asked the fish to spew out Jonah to the dry land.  </p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons learnt from Jonah's flight include:</p><p>(i) God is omnipresent, not confined to a certain place.</p><p>(ii) Men cannot run away from God.</p><p>(iii) God has a way of making man comply with His will. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Jesus met a woman at Jacob's well and asked her to give him water to drink. The woman was surprised that Jesus, a Jew would ask for water from a Samaritan. Jesus said if she knew the gift of God and who asked her for water, she would have asked him for a living water. The woman wondered how Jesus could give her water without even a vessel for drawing it out of the well. She questioned whether Jesus was greater than their father Jacob who dug the well. Jesus said every one who drank of that water would thirst again, but whoever would drink of the water he gave would never thirst, for the water he gave would become a spring of living water, leading to eternal life. The woman then asked for the living water so that she might no longer take the pains to come to the well to draw.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Application of the.teaching to christians include:</p><p>(i) Living water means the word of God.</p><p>(ii) It is for all mankind - Jews and Gentiles.</p><p>(iii) The living water through Jesus leads to eternal life. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) There was a feast of the Jews which Jesus attended in Jerusalem. There, by the sheep gate was a pool called Bethzatha by which laid a multitude of invalids. There, Jesus met a man who had been lying ill for thirty eight years and asked him if he wanted to be healed. The man said that he had no man to carry him into the water. Jesus healed him by asking him to take his pallet and walk. The man was healed and he took up his pallet and walked. This happened on the Sabbath day. The man who had just been healed by Jesus was accused by the Jews of contravening the Sabbath law by carrying his pallet on the Sabbath. They enquired from him the man who bid him to carry his pallet on the Sabbath. He was unable to identify the person who had cured him and gave him the order. Jesus had withdrawn from the crowd to avoid curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>(b) Lessons which can be drawn from the story include:</p><p>(i) Jesus shows compassion for people.</p><p>(ii) Sickness is sometimes associated with sin, therefor we must avoid sin.</p><p>(iii) Jesus has power over sickness. </p>",

Two men, Barnabas whose surname was Justus and Matthias were presented for the election. The apostles prayed for God's guidance in the selection, cast lots for them and the lots fell on Matthias and he was counted among the twelve apostles.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) Writing to the Romans on \"Civil Responsibility\", Paul admonished them to subject themselves to the governing • authorities, for there is no authority except that from God and those that exist are initiated by God. Therefore, resistance to authorities means resisting God and this leads to judgement. Rulers, Paul pointed out, do not apply sanction against the good, but upon wrong doers. The people must fear the authorities and do good and by so doing, they would be commended by their ruler. However, when they do wrong, fear overtakes them; then the ruler wields his sword on them accordingly. Therefore, they must be subject to their ruler to avoid the wrath, of God. More importantly, to have a clear conscience, they should pay their taxes and give honour to whom honour is due.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Manifestations of Good citizenship can be done as follows:</p><p>(i) Obeying the laws and regulations of the land.</p><p>(ii) Payment of taxes.</p><p>(iii) Exercising other civic responsibilities.</p><p>(iv) Assisting law enforcement agencies in the prevention of crimes. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What did James teach on partiality?</p><p> </p><p>(b) Identify two effects of partiality in society.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>James exhorts us not to show partiality. If we show partiality, we are transgressors. If for instance, a well-dressed man and a shabily - dressed one come into an assembly and you treat the well dressed man with credibility and respect and the poor man with contempt by ordering him to \"stand there\" or \"sit at my feet\", you have made distinction among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts. God has chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him. In your actions as Christians, if you fulfil the royal law (love your neighbour), you do well. He who keeps all the laws but transgresses in one is guilty of all. He who commands us not to commit adultery also forbids murder. If you do not commit adultery, but you kill, you are a transgressor of the law. Speak and act as those to be judged under the law of liberty for mercy shall not be shown to anyone who has shown no mercy.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Effects of partiality include:</p><p>(i) It brings disunity among various groups.</p><p>(ii) It promotes distrust and unhealthy rivalry.</p><p>(iii) It does not foster sense of belonging.</p><p>(iv) It encourages sycophancy and praise singing. </p>",

        "question": "<p>(a) What did Peter mean when he referred to Christians as a chosen race?</p><p> </p><p>(b) How did he expect them to behave to civil authorities? </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) The Jews always regarded themselves as descendants of Abram; as God's chosen people. Unfortunately for them, they were unable to recognize the place of Jesus in God's plan for man's salvation and therefore, they rejected him as the son of God. Their privileged position was, therefore, transferred to those who, through faith, believe in Jesus. Peter, therefore, admonished the believers in their new status, to remember that they were formerly no people in the sight of, God, but owing to their belief and faith through Jesus, they become children of God. Peter, therefore, cautioned that they should henceforth maintain good conduct among the Gentiles or unbelievers, so that, in case the latter spoke against them as wrong doers, they might see their good works and glorify God.</p><p> </p><p>(b) Peter expects Christians to subject themselves to civil authority and institutions for the Lord's sake, for God has set them up to punish wrong doers and praise those who do right. It is God's will that by doing right, they would put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men. He also teaches that as men who live under the freedom of Christ, they should not use their freedom as a cover-up for evil. As servants of God, they should honour all men, love the Christian brotherhood, fear God and honour the emperor (king). Finally, as Christian servants, they should be submissive to their earthly masters in all respects. God approves of those who, being mindful of God, endure pain while suffering unjustly. </p>",
