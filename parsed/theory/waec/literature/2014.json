        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ASARE KONADU: A Woman In Her Prime</strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the fate of childless women in Brenhoma society</p>",
        "answer": "<p>In Brenhoma, childlessness or barrenness is considered a grave misfortune because a barren woman will doomed to loneliness in her old age. She will have no child to care for her; no grandchild to enliven the compound, as well us no issue of her blood to mourn at her death. Although she will definitely be buried by her relatives, nothing is better than a woman having her own children at her funeral. This is the fate Pokuwaa is desperate not to suffer as being barren in Brenhoma is \"the worst thing that would happen a woman\".</p><p>Again, in Brenhoma the people treat barren women with lots of scorn. Pokuwaa is barren in her prime so people treat her with contempt. Even though she is fond of children and welcomes them heartily to her house; some mothers are not happy with this. For example, when Afua Fofie daughter visits Pokuwaa, Afua storms into the house and without greeting Pokuwaa, takes her little girl away. When Pokuwaa questions her, Afua Fofie cheekily responds by saying she is the mother and so has every right to take her daughter away without greeting Pokuwaa. Pokuwaa is deeply hurt and so resolves to stick to Kwadwo, her lover, and religiously performs her sacrifice as prescribed by the priest of Tano so that the gods and her ancestors will take pity on der and grant her request to have her own children.</p><p>When Kwadwo, Pokuwaa's lover, tells his wife that he will be spending seven days with his mistress, 'Fickuwaa, she protests vehemently against it arguing that she will \"not sell her rights to any barren woman\".</p><p>In Brenhoma, it is held that \"there is no difference between a barren woman and a man\" because women are supposed-to give birth to children who will perpetuate the existence of the state of Brenhoma, as well as defend the land. Thus, Pokuwaa's mother is not happy with her decision to discontinue the sacrifice she is king to the gods to grant her request to have children. She believes strongly that in Brenhoma, \"a woman gets well past fifty before her blood stops flowing\". To this end, she goes to see the head of the Asona clan, opanin Kofi Owusu and declares 'a woman who says,\" I will not give birth\" is useless, useless!</p><p>Besides, in Brenhoma, mothers also suffer the ripple effects of their daughters' fate when they are barren cause Brenhoma is a matrilineal society. Pokuwaa's mother will bear the brunt of Pokuwaa's fate because Pokuwaa is her only daughter; Pokuwna's mother tells her consistently that the children of her five brothers are not her grandchildren. They belong to their mothers' families. She add that Pokuwaa should bear her own grandchildren. Therefore, unless Pokuwaa's mother is angry and frustrated when Pokuwaa discontinues the sacrifice seeking Tano's favour for a child. Consequently, she gets very excited when Pokuwaa becomes pregnant. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>ASARE KONADU: A Woman In Her Prime</strong></p><p> </p><p>What does the death of Yaw Boakye reveal about the Brenhoma society?</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Yaw Boakye appears to be a gallant member of the Brenhoma society. One day, he goes to the bush but fails to return. His decomposing body is first seen by Pokuwaa but she is prevented by her mother from reporting to the chief for fear of being implicated. Later, when the search party of youths and warriors finds the body and brings it home for burial, the whole town is astir.</p><p>Yaw Boakye's death causes so much excitement. It triggers various activities that reveal the essential make-up of the Brenhoma community; their beliefs; unity as a people; historical experiences, traditional way of handling cases of murder; and their decorum.</p><p>Yaw's death, galvanizes the youth into action that shows the spirit of unity not only of the young people but of the entire community. The chief send out a command to all young people in the town to join in the search on pain of punishment by the great oath. </p><p>The bravery of the town appears to be legendary. It is not uncommon to have two individuals settling issues between them through combat in the bush. Such a fight could \"be carried out brutally unit death\". It could also be an attack by enemy groups, and the victim left to die in the bush. Soon enough, the final lap of the search ends in the body of Yaw Boakye.</p><p>The very discovery of the dead body reveals the attitude of the people towards the dead reverence. The group that finds the body observes the decorum that the moment demands. It announces the find with the cry of \"Wasps! Wasps! Take care!\". The message of the result of the search is relayed by the drummer and messengers are sent (into town) for the town to prepare to receive the outcome of the search that has been ordered.</p><p>That the people of Brenhoma are superstitious and highly spiritual is not in doubt. During the funeral of Yaw Boakye, the priests take centre stage. They conduct peaceful separation between the dead man arid his It this is not done, the dead man's ghost hover about, pestering his living wives.</p><p>The priest's role again is seen when the coffin refuses to move. The procession comes to a halt and it lakes the priest's intervention, the pouring of drinks of libation -for the procession to continue to the burial ground. Here the closing ceremony is performed in utter silence -no weeping is heard. Yaw Boakye's death, then, is a mirror in which the nature of the people of Brenhoma and their way of Life is reflected. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>One can hardly talk about Aunty Ifeoma and Papa-Nnukwu without mentioning Eugene. Despite being brother and sister, the two have very different outlooks on life Eugene, because of his nature, has given up on his father, whom he considers to be hell-bound. Because of this conviction, Eugene will have as little as possible to do with his father.</p><p>Aunty Ifeorna, on the other hand, is fanatically devoted to their father, never once missing an opportunity to come to his defense. Several times she has told Eugene that labeling the old man as heathen is erroneous: if Papa-Nnukwu is not Catholic, he is a traditionalist not a heathen.</p><p>Aunty Ifeoma adores her father, whom she is careful to include in their Christmas sightseeing. She listens to his stories no matter how many times he has told them. There is a special intimacy between the old man and his daughter. Papa-Nnukwu on his part loves his daughter deeply. He respects her tenacity as a single mother in their kind of society. She is permanently in his prayers. Papa-Nnukwu prays for his daughter-that her circumstances may turn around.</p><p>Petrol is in short supply when Papa-Nnukwn's health fails. Thanks to Father Amadi„ Aunty Ifeoma brings her father to Nsukka where he dies. But while he lives with her, Papa-Nnukwu's burden is borne by Aunty Ifeoma gallantly.</p><p>Determined to break Eugene's indoctrination of Kambili about Papa-Nnukwu, Aunty Ifeoma directs her to watch her grandfather at worship. Having heard and sent Papa-Nnukwu pray for everyone including Eugene, Kambili is left wondering whether there is not a mistake somewhere. He has prayed and wished everyone well. He even smiles after praying, which rarely happens in their Catholic home.</p><p>When Papa-Nnukwu dies Amity Ifeoma needs help to bury him. Eugene offers her conditional assistance for which she flares at him, There is no way Aunty Ifeoma is going to approve a Catholic funeral for her father. It is quite clear that Aunty Ifeoma holds her father in the highest esteem. Papa-Nnukwu returns this sentiment unconditionally.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Eugene's character is baffling. Some of the people who have come into contact with him are hard put to affirm whether he is a good person or a bad man\". Amaka, Eugene's niece, from what she has come to know about her uncle, is unwilling to say he is a had man, but must justify to herself that he truly is not a bad person, in the face of evidence of her uncle's cruelty to his immediate family; such as Jaja's finger. Aunty Ifeoma makes only a passing reference to it, but it is not discussed. Yet its effect on Amaka and the other children is strong and exposes Eugene to his niece and nephews as neither loving nor earing.</p><p>Amaka is scandalized by Eugene's hold over her cousins. She expresses her anger through a brutal game of teasing :Kambili about her deficiencies in domestic chores, in which her mother intervenes, urging Amaka to accommodate Kambili's very little exposure to the very ordinary things that she (Amaka) has grown used to and taken for granted: wearing shorts or lipstick, romance, music, etc.</p><p>Amaka can stretch her imagination to envision not ony the boredom imposed on her cousins but also the true nature of the harsh punishments they bear. They have no choice in anything they do and Amaka is very angry for her cousins.</p><p>Aware of Eugene's attitude towards his own father, whom she adores, Amaka cannot regard her under in a positive light. She simply cannot approve Eugene's relationship with Papa-Nnukwu.</p><p>Yet Eugene, in his own way, expresses love to all. On his visits home, he gives many people gifts, not to mention his endowment to the church. In a sense, too, he is protective of his family and provides for his home. </p><p>He cannot be a had man, really? Amaka wonders how such a generous and loving person can at the same time be cruel. </p><p>When Papa-Nnukwu dies, there arises a grave moment for the family at Nsukka. Taking the situation of the shortage of almost everything and Aunty Ifeoma's financial state together, times are hard. Then comes Eugene, who says he has sent the necessary things for his father's funeral to his sister, even though he himself will not attend nor have anything further to do with the burial of the old man.</p><p>For Amaka, the question of how to label her uncle in these circumstances becomes important and urgently needs an answer. She is impressed by the man's latest generosity. Despite her inclination to condemn the man who treats his family harshly, she relents in her condemnation. She sees Eugene's recent behaviour as positively mitigating, and so Eugene, she confesses, is not a bad man, really. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>As the leader of the whole group, Ralph has been elected democratically. He assigns rulers as best as he can. Civic responsibility is shared among the boys. Not knowing what to do with Jack, he assigns him the leadership of his choir.</p><p>Things go bad when the little ones and even older boys set hygiene aside and attend to the call of nature anywhere and anyhow. The rescue fire is neglected. All of Ralph's arrangements for a decent orderly living go haywire pretty fast.</p><p>Ralph is unable to see the shelter building project through. This is because he is unable to make anyone work. Practically, only he and Piggy shoulder the building of he shelters. This is poor leadership; When the fire is neglected and he notices a passing ship, Ralph is personally agonized. However, he is unable to articulate what it is that has gone wrong, and cannot proffer any remedy.</p><p>Several times, at meetings, Ralph goes blank and it takes Piggy to fill him in and keep his thoughts on track. His reliance on the couch for authority is legitimate. But the couch does not speak for Ralph at the critical moments; Ralph has to. Thus, Ralph fails to take the bull by the horns.</p><p>Jack, on the other band, continues in his role as leader of the choir boys who are now hunters. He takes his job seriously, probably to absurd limits. But he certainly gets results: leading others and having them do his bidding.</p><p>This may sound authoritarian. However, in a sense, keeping the boys in check is that missing adult presence that Piggy bemoans. Sack's leadership is adult-like and focused.</p><p>In the hunt the feasting and the game, everyone is a participant. In this way, there is a sense of commitment and belonging to the tribe among Jack's boys.</p><p>The assignment of roles by Jack is methodical and specific and one dare not leave one's post; one carries out instructions to the letter.</p><p>Jack's leadership is unifying and attractive. Even Ralph and Piggy are gleeful participants in the fun hunt in which Simon perishes. They have been under no avert compulsion to join the hunt.</p><p>Ralph's insistence on having been active in a pig-hunt is ridiculous. As Jack is in charge of the hunters, if Ralph hunts he does so under Jack. The overall leader may instruct or direct or superintend the hunting, but need be participate? Doing so detracts from Ralph's leadership, wobbly as it is.</p><p>All in all, it can be said that Ralph's leadership is a weak one compared to Jack's firm manner of controlling others and managing affairs.</p><p>Candidates who provide contrary views should be judged on the merit of their arguments. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>WILLIAM GOLDING: Lord Of The Flies </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the conflict of order and chaos in the novel.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The central concern is the conflict between two strong drives in human society: order and chaos. These translate as the quest to live by law and order, to value the good of others versus the drive to satisfy one's personal interests and use of force to establish one's supremacy over others, on the other hand. Throughout the novel, Golding associates the drive for order with civilization or good, and the drive for chaos with savagery.</p><p>The conflict between the two is explored in the narrative about the degeneration; of English boys from civilized, moral, and disciplined behavior to a wild, brutal, excessively harsh, and murderous existence in the Jungle.</p><p>The novelist conveys most of his central ideas through symbols which transcend characters and objects. The conflict between order and chaos is represented in the conflict between two major characters: Ralph, the protagonist who represents order, and Jack, his antagonist who represents savagery with his morbid thirst for power.</p><p>As the novel progresses, Golding shows how the drive for order and chaos impacts on people differently: Piggy, for example, is not influenced negatively. He tends for the intellectuals and scientific principle of arguing to arrive at the truth or order.</p><p>Jack, on the other hand, seems bereft of the principle of order. He represents brutality, savagery and blood-lust at its most deplorable slate.</p><p>William Golding tends to pass on a message; the human psyche is more prone to chaos than to order. He portrays moral conduct many times in a lot of instances as superimposed by civilization rather than natural human mind which evinces evil, cruelty and savagery. The idea of innate human evil is notably evident through recurring symbols like the head of the sow on a stake and \"the beast\".</p><p>The influence of order and chaos reigns throughout the novel. Indeed, there are places where chaos seems to overpower order, where Ralph's boys are brutally murdered. In the end, however order dominates all the action as the boys are rescued. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Much is learnt from Santiago's life as a fisherman. In the first place, his humble background and simple needs are informative. Although he has gone out to sea for 84 days without a catch and neighbours in the community consider him luckless, `salas' in spite of earlier successes, he is not one to give up. This demonstrates his great tenacity that never-say-die spirit which lets him go out to sea again.</p><p>We learn that perseverance and tenacity help a lot, and that one must not give up easily when the odds go against us.</p><p>The boy, Manolin's relationship with Santiago is also a useful lesson to learn. He is an old man and he needs the boy just as much as the boy loves him. Manolin is able to read the old man's mind and determine his his needs. He provides him food, keeps him company and helps him carry his fishing gear to and from the skiff. Thus, the boy is sorely missed on that ill-fated expedition to catch the big fish. The old man cannot have felt lonelier and keeps on regretting the boy's absence: Here he provides another lesson which is the support a fisherman needs from others. This is clearly a cooperative enterprise and the old in in learns this lesson at great cost.</p><p>It is clear that no man is an island, We help one another. The old can be friends with the young and the young friends' with the old. 'This relationship is mutually beneficial.</p><p>Apart from the cooperation required, there are also the uncertainties at sea. The old man is unable to unable to predict how long it'll take him to catch a fish, nor 'where exactly to find it, in spite of some telltale signs. He does not also know how big' his catch will he and therefore cannot adequately prepare for all eventualities. This lack of adequate preparation and equipment is badly exposed when he is unable, finally, to ward off the attacking sharks which eat up his big catch. We also learn from the old man's respect for the marlin, that we should show respect to our rivals.</p><p>Finally the old man's attitude to the sea which he calls `la mar' when others call it 'el mar', indicates a certain love relationship. Thus; no matter how badly he has been treated by the sea, lie is prepared to go back again and again. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: The Old Man and the Sea</strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the narrative techniques used in the novel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The story of Santiago who goes out to sea and returns with the skeleton of the largest fish he has ever caught is captivating because of Hemingway's choice of narrative technique.</p><p>The story begins to be told from the third person or authorial point of view. \"He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days flow without taking a fish\". Santiago's physical build-up, his humble, virtually lonely life and sea fishing activities are told in the voice of this third person who seems to know so much about fishing and describes in detail all the kinds of equipment Santiago possesses and all the activities he goes through at sea, including weather-watching and fighting the sharks that attack his fish. This third person also seems to like Santiago very much, and approves of his attitude said empathizes with his disappointment and suffering.</p><p>But much of the story is also told in dialogue between Santiago and Manolin, the little boy who is always there for him, even when his parents order him to join another boat, since the old man is luckless, \"salao\". The bond between the old man and the boy is strongly (bit throughout their interactions and even when the old man is at sea and alone, he never ceases to miss the company of Manolin. There is also the use of the interior monologue, much of which is evident in Santiago's engagement with the marlin and the sharks. He is often seen talking to himself and giving himself encouragement when all seems to be lost. He even talks to the big fish, and sees himself in a contest of will and endurance with it. He respects its nobility and fights the sharks to preserve it until they unrelentantly eat it up Much of Santiago's thoughts and responses are presented in this manner with great pathos.</p><p>The use of flashback is also a narrative technique, which Santiago relies on to recall past incidents. Thus, Hemingway's use of the four modes of narration enables Santiago's story to be told from different perspectives, so that the reader's interest is sustained throughout. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Both characters belong to the educated class and were both educated in England. Apart from this scant reference about Mr. Borofosem, a few more things are said about Mr Onyimdze while he was in England. He trained as a lawyer, and lived an almost recluse life, deliberately not allowing his ability to speak English to suppress his Fanti. Therefore, he spoke Fanti to himself whenever he could.</p><p>In Cape Coast, Mr Onyimdze, who is unmarried, establishes a law firm and is eugaged in active practice. Mr. Borofosem, however, has a wife, Mrs Borofosem, whom he allows to henpeck him and virtually direct what he does in the matrimonial home. He is not allowed to speak Fanti, though he loves to; he must be kissed by his wife, and he must smoke and leave the ashes on the carpet. He suffers his wife's domination indulgently, all for peace to prevail. He dare not speak Fanti while Mrs Borofosem is around and while he follows her to the Cosmopolitan Club.</p><p>Mr Onyimdze, however, loves his Fanti language, food, clothes and all. As soon as he returns home from court, he is in his element: he changes from English and formal dress, which belongs to the court, into African clothes. He is also indulgent, and accepts to educate Mr Okadu, whose sole desire to learn English is to be able to woo and marry Miss Tsiba, whose father has sent her to Mrs Borofosem to learn English and English manners. Seeing his mistake in encouraging the relationship between Mr Okadu and Miss Tsiba, who get hurriedly married in chu, he switches to the side of Miss Tsiba's grandmother, Nana Katawerwa, when she sues for the annulment of the marriage and asks Mr Onyimdze to represent her in court. By winning the bigamy case, Mr Onyimdze protects traditional values against western encroachment and brings back all those anglicised characters, like Mrs Borofosem, to appreciate their culture.</p><p>In the end, Mr Borofosem recognizes the wisdom of tradition: \"The people of the old days were wise indeed: if only we would follow the customs they left us a little more, and adopt the ways of other races a little less, we should be at least as healthy as they were\". </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The play satirises the colonial life of the .Write society in particular and the African society in general by highlighting some of the negative effects of colonialism.</p><p>The blind imitation of the western culture and social habits by some characters such. as Mr and Mrs Borofosem, Mr. Okadu, Mr. Tsiba, officers and members of the Cosmopolitan Club is emphasized as such characters consider their own culture inferior to Western culture.</p><p>The semi-literate Mrs Borofosem, for example, is happy that she was not born in the dark old days of her ancestors but she ironically admits that they lived longer than her own generation of civilized people. She insists that her husband should call her \"duckie\" because, back in Seaborne in England, a friend of hers was called \"duckie\" by ber husband.</p><p>Her husband, Mr Borofosem, right at the beginning of the play, regrets the day he took his wife to England because everything must be done the English way as far as she is concerned. An instance is when she seolds Nyamekye for removing the leaves she has placed in a book to dry and for trying to sweep the cigar-ashes on the carpets. According to her the ashes are used to kill the moths in the carpet in England. </p><p>Mr Tsiba is seen going to the extreme trying to \"civilize\" his daughter by taking her to the semi-literate Mrs Borofosem to be taught English and English manners. He does not mind what kind of tuition she receives s Borofosem.</p><p>The African cherished values of marital engagement are disregarded in favour of the Western form of engagement. This is illustrated the way Mr. Okadu and Miss Tsiba handle their engagement. It starts at a party with no parental knowledge and approval. This engagement has a tragic consequence as the would-be bride loses her mother and becomes pregnant too. Although they proceed with the engagement up to the wedding, the reception is disrupted by Nana Katawerwa, Miss Tsiba's grandmother, who points it out to them that, customarily, no one has come to the family to express their interest in Miss Tsiba, let alone engage her.</p><p>The abuse of funeral rites is also highlighted. Mr Tsiba is unable to stay in the widower's room for the prescribed period. Instead, he is out attending his daughter's wedding, barely a week after his wife's death. There is a shift from African food and drinks to English ones. The \"affected\" characters not only eat European food and drink European drinks but also use the cutlery. A clear example is Ms Tsiba. When he becomes aware that he is eating with his hand, he asks the boy. why the cutlery is missing. He is reminded at he enjoys his food without using cutlery.</p><p>The blind imitation of western culture extends even to clothing. Those who wear traditional outfit are considered \"savage\" or \"uncivilized\". When Mr Tsiba is informed he has visitors, he quickly hides his food in a cupboard and goes in to change from his native cloth into a pair of pyjamas.</p><p>Their use of the English language is also ridiculed. Mrs. Borofosem who pretends to speak no other language than English can hardly make any sensible utterance in that language without an error. Examples include \"I never hear that before. Fine big name, very nice. I will always call her Erimintrude\", etc.</p><p>The highfalutin and at times meaningless words used by officers and members of the Cosmopolitan Club illustrate this point. They appear to be more English than the English, but it is clear they are only semi-literate. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Lawumi and Anlugbua are ancestral deities. Lawumi is Anlugbua's grandmother while the latter is the son of Oba Asunkungbade, the ancestral founder of Owu.</p><p>The two deities meet to discuss the tragedy that has befallen the city. Anlugbua claims ignorance and accuses Lawumi of colluding with the Allied Forces to destroy Owu, which Lawumi admits. She explains that Owu's tragedy arose from her arrogance towards her and the violation of the agreement concerning not selling fellow Yorubas as slaves to foreigners.</p><p>Lawumi explains her role, revealing that she is the one that encourages the Owu to attack the Ife and to take the Apomu market back, which consequently leads to the retaliation of the Allied Forces. However, Lawumi insists that the Allied Forces must be punished for the desecration and destruction of her shrine. To execute this, she solicits Anlugbua's support.</p><p>The meeting also reveals that Lawumi has consulted Esu, who has promised to throw the Allied Forces into confusion, while Orisa Oko, the hunters' god, is to turn the forest against them, thus making their return Journey more agonizing. Anlugbua's role, however, is to send lightning upon the Allied Forces destroy them.</p><p>The Anlugbua and Lawumi interaction exposes the human nature of the gods: they are vindictive, unreliable and susceptible to human frailties after all. It also provides an insight into the cause of the destruction of Owu, namely, their selling fellow Yoruba kinsmen into slavery and their display of arrogance.</p><p>The meeting also highlights the fact that human beings are mere playthings in the hands of the gods; they deal with them as they like. For instance, in spite of Anlugbua's initial reluctance, he agrees to join forces with Lawumi to punish the Allied Forces. When Lawumi tells Anlugbua that Ogun has agreed to join them in the destruction, Anlugbua says, \"Then it shall be done as you wish.\" </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>FEMI OSOFISAN: Women of Owu </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine the role of chorus in advancing the plot.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The chorus in traditional Greek theatre is a group of actors on stage who comment on the action in the play. In this play, the chorus is made up of the group of OWu women who survived the destruction of the city and are partakers of the suffering in its aftermath. They perform several roles in the play. Not only do they provide information on the current events in the play, they also provide information on past events; they warn the people about the consequences of certain actions; admonish, mediate and encourage the other women to face various challenges they are passing through. Of course, they also play the role of custodian of the people's tradition and culture.</p><p>First, they plead with Anlugbua, their ancestral father, to intervene on behalf of Owu. When Anlugbua refuses, the chorus leader admonishes the women to cast off their despair, and summon courage to face the challenges at hand because \"it's us, not the gods who create the war. It's us human beings who can kill it\". The chorus also warn Erelu to prepare to for the worst.</p><p>They empathize with Erelu on the calamities that have befallen her, especially that concerning Orisaye who seems to be losing her senses. They ask Erelu to take good care so as not to hurt herself, even as they mourn with her as Adumaadan hands over her only son, Aderogun, to Gesinde to be killed. They call Erelu's attention to his corpse when it is brought to be buried. They dance round the boy's body and apologize \"for bringing you to the world and having to send you away so early and so harshly.\"</p><p>This tragedy notwithstanding, the chorus warn Erelu and caution her against speaking evil of the gods.</p><p>The chorus also take on vicariously, the suffering of Owu. While the disaster continues, they encourage people to have hope and curse the Allied Forces. As one puts it, \"May you all without exception suffer the indignity of unremembered graves.\"</p><p>As custodian of and participants in the culture and tradition of Owu kingdom, the chorus remind Erelu of the rites of passage that fate has thrust on her to perform since all the priests and princes have been killed and such spirits need someone to release them to meet their ancestors.</p><p>The chorus also invoke Anlugbua's spirit and plead on behalf of those who died and must go home and for those who live they ask for forgiveness. Through them, Anlugbua promises that Owu will rise again, not as a single city but in little communities within other cities of Yorubaland. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON - AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>BERNARD SHAW: Arms and the Man </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the theme of heroism in the play.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>There is a sense in which the play deals with the theme of heroism. There is heroism based on idealism. This kind is manifested by Sergius, a proud upper class figure, who is very conscious of his aristocratic background, coming, as he does, from a family with the highest rank in the army.</p><p>Sergius's claim to heroism lies in his leading the charge against the Serbian army during the war between the two nations. His exploits are recounted as the Serbian army is routed and he returns home to earn a promotion on that account. That exploit also earns him the adoration of his fiancée, Raffia, as well as her mother, Catherine. However, it takes Captain Bluntschli on the Serbian side to give an account of the true events on the battlefield to downgrade Sergius's achievement. On the battlefield he showed more bravado than bravery and lost more men than should have been the case, especially when the Serbians had less ammunition.</p><p>Sergius pays dearly for what could have made him a real hero. He loses both rank and fiancée as a consequence of his foolhardy handling of the war.</p><p>But there is the other kind of the hero represented Bluntschli. His opposition to war makes him carry chocolate in the cartridge of his gun, instead of real bullets. And he saves himself when all appears lost by seeking refuge in Raina's bedroom. What appears to be an unheroic act turns out to be the more realistic option. It is his forthrightness and practical mindedness that earn him Raina's love and their eventual marriage.</p><p>Bluntschli's pragmatism and military skill also make him heroic. While Catherine is at her wits' end as to how to get rid of him, Sergius and Petkoff are racking their brains as to how to dispatch the three calvary regiments to Philippopolis. Bluntschli comes to the rescue, bringing relief to the two whose already high regard for Bluntschli rises even higher.</p><p>Yet, there is the other act of heroism which is illustrated by Louka. Discontent with her lower class status, she vows to improve her status by fair or foul means. She ensures she breaks the relationship between Sergius and Raina by eavesdropping on Raina's conversation with Bluntschli and reporting same to Sergius. Eventually, she turns Sergius's attention towards her and they both break class barriers by marrying. That is a heroic achievement in a class conscious society. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON - AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>BERNARD SHAW: Arms and the Man </strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the significance of the battle at Slivnitza. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The battle at Slivnitza is between the Bulgarian and the Serbian forces in the ongoing war. This battle takes place in the \"little town near the Dragoman pass\" on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia. The winner of the battle is the Bulgarian side as a result of the \"able\" leadership of Major Sergius Saranoff. The victory sets off the action of the play as Mrs Catherine Petkoff shouts the good news to her daughter, Raina, when the play opens: \"A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory' by Sergius\". Both Catherine and Raina are excited as they await their hero's return. Thus, the theme of war and love are highlighted in the play.</p><p>The victory makes Catherine proud of Sergius who is Raina's fiancé, though it is not clear the relationship is based on true love since Catherine insists that Raina should henceforth show greater love to Sergius.</p><p>The war dominates the action of the play reported. Most of the characters are introduced as the war is being discussed. Characters like Major Sergius and Captain Bluntschli reveal themselves through their war experiences.</p><p>Bluntschli's attempt to escape capture by enemy soldiers drives him to take refuge in Raina' s bedroom. This encounter results in a romance which culminates in the marriage between Bluntschli and Raina. Also, Sergius's character as a foolhardy general who cares little about the safety of the soldiers under his command is brought to light.</p><p>This explodes the myth of heroism relating to war exploits. The good commander is the one who saves life whenever this is possible, as in the case of Bluntschli, not the one who does not care whether his soldiers die or live as long as he wins the battle. The good soldier lives to fight another day. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>At the invitation of Jack and Algernon, Dr Chasuble arrives at the Manor house to rechristenthe two. He discovers that the arrangement has been cancelled and decides to join Miss Prism whom he says has been waiting for him in the vestry for an hour and a half. </p><p>The mention of this name arouses racknell's curiosity as she seeks to know the identity of Miss Prism. When she eventually sees her, events begin to unfold leading to the discovery of Jack's true identity as Algernon's brother.</p><p>This scene leads to the resolution the conflict that has been generated in the play. The question of Jack's identity which has served as an obstacle to his union with Gwendolen is finally laid to rest. The true identity of his parents is also revealed. Just as Jack and Gwendolen can now marry so can Cecily and Algernon.</p><p>Gwendolen's extreme curiosity is made known in this scene. The revelation of Jack's background is not enough for her as she tries to make an issue out of it. Her desire to know Jack's true name helps in bringing Jack's \"honesty\" to the fore. Here, the playwright's deliberate satire on the aristocrats who hold such a trivial thing as a name as a condition for marriage is heightened.</p><p>The scene also depicts Miss Prism, as one with little or no sense of remorse. She fails to render an apology for the misdeed of placing a baby in a bag at a railway station, twenty-eight years earlier. Yet she is the person who sheds light on all the tangles that are unravelled in the play. T</p><p>he discovery of Jack's name as Ernest lends credence to Jack's pun on the word, \"Ernest\". It also heightens the irony of his earlier pretence. He is surprised that he has been living under a false name all along. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The Importance of Being Earnest, it is quite clear that Wilde draws a picture of the life of two main classes in the society: the lower and upper classes. The likes of Miss Prism arid Lane are in the lower class whereas Lady Bracknell, Gwendolen, Algernon and Jack belong to the upper class.</p><p>Presuming to be entitled to the best things of life, the upper class holds itself out as superior to the lower.</p><p>From a distance, one is expected to regard Algernon, and Jack and Lady Bracknell as a select group who have wards, servants, governesses and country residences. The outside appearance is glamorous. However, seen at close quarters the upper class is not such a special class in terms of morality and ordinary expectations. From the events of the play one forms the impression that the upper class is basically pretentious and hypocritical.</p><p>The conspiracy of Algernon and Lane, Algernon's lie and \"bunburyism\", Jack's double life and Lady Bracknell, who was a nobody in her single status, all indicate that their being born with a silver spoon in their mouths is a sham.</p><p>Various events and incidents exemplify upper-class pretentiousness. Algernon blatantly condones what he should have found reprehensible as he aids Lane to lie and deliberately eats up the cucumber sandwiches he has prepared for his aunt, He sneaks out to the address that he so ignobly procures through his sly eavesdropping on Jack and Owendolen's conversation as a means of escaping London life, which he calls \"bunburyism\". Jack also creates a notorious brother called Ernest to be able to leave the countryside and walk into London at will.</p><p>Both the conversation between Gwendolen and Cecily and Lady Bracknell's list and interview of Jack are instances of the high handed treatment of the lower class by the upper class.</p><p>The frivolous, materialistic view of the upper class to marriage is farcical. It smacks of- hypocrisy and impropriety.</p><p>From their high horse of apparent self-satisfaction, members of the upper class give the careful observer the impression that they are covering up. To do this, they are fill of pretention. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Umeh uses predominating visual images to express his disgust with the corruption which is prevalent in African societies. There is an omission of shared guilt as everyone is adjudged to be corrupt.</p><p>The negative activities of the so-called \"Ambassadors\" expose the depth of the corruption in these societies. They are all \"Ambassadors of Poverty\" aiving the word \"ambassador\" an ironical twist, \"corrupt masters of the economy and determined merchants of the loot\". In one way or the other, these contribute to the impoverishment of the nation.</p><p>The visual image involving \"the head abroad and the anus at home\" emphasizes the stench of the endemic corruption in the society. There is the image of government workers who are described as \"office loafers\" and barons of incompetence. They too are corrupt; their corrupt activities impoverish the nation.</p><p>Then follows groups of other images involving \"the landlords\" who charge exorbitant rents, thus contributing to the theme of corruption.

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>Consider the presentation of the theme of poverty in \"Myopia\"</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The poem is made up of three uneven stanzas. The end of each stanza develops the theme. The final and longest stanza shows the persona's resolution as well as his attitude towards those whom society has impoverished. </p><p>The poem opens with a statement on the plight of the peasants - miserable, vulnerable and rain-battered. They are not hidden in some countryside obscurity. In the midst of the affluent they suffer their misery. They shiver \"in their emaciated bones/along the boulevards of misery\". The oxymoron \"boulevards of misery\" is a powerifil expression that captures the stark misery of the poor peasants. The image produced by the contrast between the rich and the poor is carried over to the second stanza by the deliberate explication of the boulevards in relation to the vehicle that plies it: \"a train of anguish\". In a powerful metaphor, the impractical infrastructure is described as \"railway tracks in my heart\" on which \"a train of anguish runs\". There is the rage of hunger when the rice pads have become unproductive and unresponsive to fertilizer.  </p><p>In the third stanza the poem confronts the problem of the plight of the poor. He looks for \"the incendiary bomb\" made from the \"skeleton of stillborn promises\". He is fed up with the mad system amidst the unkept promises of the leaders. The neglected rice pads of the country deepen the misery of those who feed the people: the peasants.</p><p>The paradox of the hangman hanging himself portrays his determination to get rid of corrupt politicians and sanitize the society once and for all. However, that is not all.</p><p>The poet makes the form of the poem fit the nature of his passion. There is economy of lines when he says a lot in a few lines. On the other hand, when he opens up and qualifies what he puts forward, he requires longer stanzas. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Having dismissed the astrologers as unreliable, the poet goes on to address with displeasure man' regrettable attitude to God as regards his belief in astrology.</p><p>The poet sees man as incredibly thoughtless and faithless for locking up the endowments bestowed upon him by God.</p><p>He laments man's failure to appreciate the fact that God loves him so much that He makes and places him over and above all other creatures and even makes the angels to do his bidding.</p><p>The poet continues by chiding man for his inexplicable ignorance and stupidity in seeking salvation and refuge in fortune-tellers who themselves are as \"blind\" as their \"calculations\" and as \"drunken\" as their \"conjectures\".</p><p>It baffles the poet that man is so short-sighted that he gives little or no thought to God's omnipotence and fails to realize that it is only in him that \"all truth\", \"all influence\" and \"all fate\" reside. Still more baffling is his forgetfulness that it is by dint of hard work that man can work himself into \"a glorious man\" since \"man is his own star\"</p><p>The poet also finds man's fear of such facts of life as affliction, sickness and even death as worrisome. Man who is believed to be filled with the spirit of God needs not fear such things since affliction and sickness are the test of endurance and inner will while death is \"but another night\", a mere transition. </p>",
