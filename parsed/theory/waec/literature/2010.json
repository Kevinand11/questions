        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>ATHOL FUGARD: Sizwe Bansi is Dead. </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the dramatic techniques employed in the play. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Athol Fugard employs a number of dramatic techniques to convey the conditions of black South Africans in an oppressive system. These include: The use of flashback: Flashback is a dominant dramatic technique used in the play. Events unfold through flashback as Styles reflects on the conditions of the black South Africans in Ford Motors. Through this technique, the audience is made to be aware of the oppressive and the exploitative nature of the apartheid system on the black worker who is kicked out if he dares challenge the white foreman. Sizwe's experiences in the house of Zola are also re-enacted through flashback.</p><p>The use of Characters: Fugard's use of a few characters is also an aspect of how he generates interest in the play. There are only three characters, namely; Styles, Sizwe and Buntu and the action of the play is seen from their perspective. Styles is the dominant character who re-enacts most of the injustices of the white regime and the inhuman treatment the black South African workers receive.</p><p>The use of the Dramatic Monologue: The dramatic monologue is seen as the dominant narrative technique employed by the playwright. Styles' utterances and actions as he plays several roles reveal the evils of apartheid in the plight, as well as the hopes of the oppressed blacks.</p><p>The use of Symbols: Several things stand for various ideas. The photographic studio itself represents a place where Styles creates a dream world for the suffering blacks in a situation where their hopes have been shattered by the unjust system. Buntu's house stands for a rehabilitation centre for the blacks. Cockroaches represent the oppressors whom Styles, who represents his people, is determined to exterminate. Other symbols include the use of the insecticide \"Doom\", and the Cat, which also represent his attempt to overcome oppression, while the Camera offers hope. Styles' newspaper headlines open up his mind to the realities and possibilities in and outside his immediate world.</p><p>Use of Irony: Irony is used to reinforce the dehumanising condition of the black man. It is ironical that Sizwe has to use a dead man's passport to survive and earn a living in his own native land. Other dramatic techniques employed in the play include miming and mimicry, use of the epistolary style, the absence of features like acts and scenes and the concentration of the setting in styles' studio. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>In the play, symbols are used to represent the various predicaments of black people. There is the symbol of the photographic studio which becomes a temporary refuge for blacks who are crippled economically and socially and who indulge their fantasy in taking pictures. Sizwe Bansi, as an asylum seeker, finds this studio a temporary place of refuge.</p><p>The \"cockroaches\" symbolize the oppressive white settlers; the \"Doom\" applied by Styles on the cockroaches represents all the ineffective actions taken to free South Africa from racial discrimination.</p><p>The \"cat\" is used to remind the blacks that they need a greater force to free themselves from the oppressive regime; the \"passbook\" that the blacks are made to carry is a symbol used to highlight the evils of apartheid. Without a valid passbook characters like Sizwe Bansi are limited in their movement and in securing gainful employment.</p><p>Death, itself, is used symbolically to represent rest and peace for the oppressed blacks. The harsh conditions faced by the blacks make them wish to die. There is also Buntu's house which becomes a rehabilitation centre and Buntu himself is made a rehabilitation officer for Sizwe Bansi. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The conflicts in the play can be seen from different perspectives, ranging from the generational gap involving choice of profession to betrayal of trust and domestic misunderstanding.</p><p>One of the major conflicts in the play is the generational gap involving choice of profession. James Ofosu believes it is his parental responsibility to choose a career for his children and having chosen for the first two sons, he considers Aaron and Maanan's refusal to accept his choice as an act of disobedience. This conflict results in the strainec relationship between him and the two children. It takes Awere's success in painting and Lawyer Bonu's betrayal of trus:. for James to accept the children's choices. .</p><p>There is also domestic conflict which is more pronounced between Mrs. Hannah Ofosu and Aunt Fosuwa tha between James and his wife. On the one hand, while aunt Fosuwa disputes over who has responsibility over the family_ Hannah and James are at logger-heads over his friendship with Lawyer Bonu. Again, it takes Lawyer Bonu's betrayal or trust to resolve this conflict.</p><p>Of the three major conflicts, that between Lawyer Bonu and James, though much delayed, is never resolved. as Lawyer Bonu's betrayal of trust to establish this conflict.</p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>JOE DE GRAFT: Sons and Daughters </strong></p><p> </p><p>Compare and contrast the roles of Hannah and Fosuwa in the play. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>In attitude, roles and disposition, Hannah and Aunt Fosuwa are poles apart. Hannah is James' wife while Aunt is his sister. Hannah is portrayed as a dutiful and loving wife and mother. She sees to it that her husband's and dren's needs are met. She is capable of discernment. Thus she recognizes that Awere is a good influence on her son and consequently approves Awere's friendship with her children.</p><p>On the other hand, Aunt Fosuwa is depicted as a jealous and envious woman in her relationship with Hannah and her children. While she will not let Hannah enjoy her marriage, her plans regarding Hannah's children and their friends also ill-motivated. For example, she hates Awere because she feels there is a relationship between Awere and aanan which will overturn her plans to make Maanan Lawyer Bonu's second wife.</p><p>Hannah, unlike Aunt Fosuwa, believes in the sanctity of marriage and stays with her husband against all odds, While Aunt Fosuwa believes in polygamy, having unsuccessfully married three times. She not only actively encourages Maanan to be Lawyer Bonu's second wife, but also urges Hannah to break her own marriage.</p><p>A perfect role Hannah plays in the play is to show tolerance and understanding in all situations. In spite of James' intemperance and set ways, she is able to accommodate him as she does Aunt Fosuwa. Aunt Fosuwa, on the other and, has no self-discipline in her attitude to marriage and children. She is rather permissive. Her encouragement of Lawyer Bonu's overtures to Maanan emboldens him and leads to the betrayal of James' trust and friendship. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The Mayor is a long serving civil-servant in charge of one of the provinces of St. Petersburg and he is the husband of Anna. They both have a daughter called Marya.</p><p>The Mayor is never satisfied with whatever he has but wants more. Anna is like the husband because she is not satisfied with her husband alone and flirts openly with Hiestakov, the so-called Government Inspector. The Mayor never discharges his duties as expected of an honest civil servant and Anna also does not discharge her duties as a faithful wife in the home.</p><p>The Mayor lacks scruples. He suggests to the other civil servants that the Inspector's visit notwithstanding, they should maintain the status quo i.e. the collection of bribes should continue as usual. Anna also lacks scruples; she competes with her daughter for Hlestakov.</p><p>They are both ambitious. As the husband is dreaming of becoming a General, Anna is dreaming of living in the city. Anna is very inquisitive and asks Hlestakov a lot of questions about city people.</p><p>The Mayor becomes flustered at the news of the visit of the government inspector. Anna, on the other hand, is calm even when she knows her husand is aware of her flirtation with the Government Inspector. He is selfish. He indulges in self-praise and praises himself to Hlestakov without being aware of it. As an opportunist, he encourages Hiestakov to flirt with his wife because he sees it as an opportunity to be promoted to the rank of General. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN DRAMA </strong></p><p><strong>NIKOLAI GOGOL: The Government Inspector </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine three comic scenes in the play. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>There are many comic scenes in the play. One such scene occurs where Hlestakov has no money to pay for his accumulated bills in the inn, but still threatens the Landlord and the waiter for refusing his demand for more food and not being properly attended to by the inn keeper. When food is eventually served, though he has not paid a single Rouble for it, he still complains about its quality. The comic element in this scene emanates from the absurdity of Hlestakov's behaviour.</p><p>The scene where Bob and Dob attempt to report the arrival of the expected Government Inspector is equally comic. Both are at their comic best competing to announce the arrival. In their foolish eagerness they misrepresent Hlestakov as the expected Government Inspector, thus setting the stage for the action of the play.</p><p>Gogol also creates another comic scene when Yosif, thinking that the Landlord of the inn has reported them to the Mayor for their debts, quickly informs Hlestakov that the Mayor has come to arrest and put them in prison. Ironically, it is the Mayor who believes Hlestakov is the Government Inspector being expected from Petersburg and has come to meet him.</p><p>It is also funny and ridiculous that the Mayor should bribe Hlestakov with a \"loan\" of 400 Roubles fearing that he is the Government Inspector, while, in fact, Hlestakov is a spendrift and no Government Inspector.</p><p>Yet another comic scene is created where mother and daughter compete for Hlestakov's attention under the full glare of the Mayor. They dress to kill and fantasize about him and even quarrel about who is best qualified to woo him.</p><p>Also comic is the scene where the Mayor fantasizes about when his daughter Marya, would get married to Hiestakov. He boasts about it in the province and all the officials go to the Mayor's house with their wives to congratulate him on his soon becoming the father-in-law of the Government Inspector. The Mayor cuts a very ridiculous figure as he struts around, gloating on his own imagined position and importance.</p><p>The last scene in the play after the interception of Hlestakov's letter by the Postmaster is as comic as all the others. Here all the characters lick their wounds and count their losses as they confess their stupidity in allowing Hiestakov to dupe them. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN DRAMA</strong></p><p><strong>ROBERT BOLT: A Man For All Seasons </strong></p><p> </p><p>Examine the play as a conflict between king Henry's desires and More's principles.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>It is quite evident in the drama that the King's heartiest wishes are ones that More cannot endorse. Mare's stand is that what the King wants to have are against his moral and religious principles. On the King's part, he has married a queen who is unable to bear a son and so must be divorced. Meanwhile he has found a younger woman he wishes to marry.</p><p>The King, to make his self conviction strong, reasons that the setting aside of a church provision to make his marrying his late brother's wife possible is also unlawful. He therefore wants to set matters right by having that marriage annulled. The King also considers the Pope as a mere archbishop who must not lord it over other people from his church in Rome. England can have its own church and its Archbishop.</p><p>To succeed in implementing his desires, the King must have More's support as his Chancellor and friend. More will not co-operate. His reasons are ones based on principle and religion.</p><p>More strongly believes that it is wrong to give public approval for the divorce of Queen Catherine and the marriage of the King to Anne Boleyn. The Pope had been persuaded to set aside a biblical injunction on marriage between King Henry VIII and his brother's widow. Asking the Pope to reverse that is not morally right as far as More is concerned. He also strongly opposes the King's attacks on the abbeys and his policy of reformation.</p><p>The King's disregard for the Pope shocks More. He thinks that breaking away from Rome is sacrilegious. He strongly believes that the Pope is God's representative and must not be rebuffed. Therefore, he refuses to swear the Oath in support of the king's desire and does not give reasons. He opposes the Act of Parliament that approves the legitimacy of the King's marriage with Anne Boleyn.</p><p>At this point, More and King Henry VIII are on a collision course. In the end, the King has his way without More's support. More resigns as Chancellor but he loses his life. If he will not agree with the King, More must die. He dies in the belief that he has lived and stood by his conscience and that he has been true to his moral and religious principles. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Professionally, both are legal scholars and important public officers. More is a principled and God-fearing man. This is seen when he refuses to give public approval to Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn. He also refuses to accept bribe. At home, he is a good family man.</p><p>Cromwell, on the other hand, has no moral scruples and will do anything for position and money. These contrasting aspects of their characters are played out in the drama. For example, Cromwell's lack of moral scruples makes him a willing tool in the hands of the King. To satisfy the King's desire to remarry (which More is opposed to), he viciously implicates More in the bribery scandal and gets him executed in the end.</p><p>One other area where More and Cromwell contrast in character is the way they view friendship. While More is sincere and willing to help for a good cause, Cromwell is not. For example, more befriends Rich to improve the young man's moral and career development while Cromwell's friendship with Rich is exploitative and geared towards the acquisition of power, influence and money.</p><p>Judging from More's character as it develops in the play, one may consider him as naive even when he stands in great danger of his life and has virtually all his family opposing him. But More lives and dies for his principles. Cromwell, on the other hand, stands on no higher moral ground than his own material comfort which he pursues, vengefully. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>\"Songs\" of sorrow I &amp; II is a pessimistic poem. It is a dirge in which the living blame the ancestors for the hardship and difficulties that their departure has left behind. Much of this meaning is conveyed through several important images used in the poem.</p><p>The desolation and helplessness that has occurred is presented right at the beginning of \"Songs of Sorrow I\" in the image of the 'chameleon faces'. The image is appropriate as it conjures up the picture of something that cannot be wiped away or cleaned. It is this,catastrophe that is emphasized by the use of this image.</p><p>A series of other images closely associated with desolation, destruction and even death is used in successive parts of the poem. References can be made to images like the \"sun and rain\" that burn and beat respectively; the gun that can no longer be fired because there are no sons; other plant and animal images such as \"the sharp stumps;\" the falling \"tree\" which also symbolizes the death of Agosu, an important family elder, the\" broken fences\"; the \"snake\", the \"crow\" and the \"vulture\" which are all destructive creatures. The \"wilderness\" is not spared in reference to its desolation.</p><p>The overwhelming feeling in the poem is that nothing has gone right since the departure of the ancestors and only suffering remains 'or survivors like the persona. Even those who travel and return have to confront a life of misery. An entire civilization or way of life represented by \"Kpeti\"s great household\" is no more. What are left are the broken fences now taken over by entire strangers.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>An African thunderstorm is a highly descriptive poem about the ravages caused by a typical storm.</p><p>The two aspects of the storm — its characteristics and its effects — are clearly brought out. In respect of its characteristics, the storm, as a natural phenomenon, is presented as destructive and fearsome. The wind that blows in its wake \"tosses up things in its tails/like a madman chasing nothing\" \"or like a plague of locusts\". .</p><p>The above two similes emphasize the chaos that is caused. The impression formed is that of some brute force tha: is being unleashed. There is a sense of the foreboding as the \"pregnant clouds\" gather to \"perch on hills\". Hell appears to break loose as nothing is spared in the wind's trail. As the accompanying thunder is unleashed and the storm's effects diminish, this is felt in the onomatopoeia words \"tremble\", \"rumble\", \"crack\" and \"pelting\".</p><p>The storm's effects on its surroundings are also conveyed in words that appeal to the senses. \"Screams of delighted children\" contrast with the frenzied movement of women carrying their babies on their backs upon sensing danger. Their clothes are torn apart, \"exposing dangling breasts\". Not spared, even, are the trees which \"bend\" to let it pass. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN POETRY </strong></p><p> </p><p>How effective is Housman's use of Imagery in \"To An Athlete Dying Young?\".</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The poem is about the premature death of a young athlete, which sets the poet reflecting on the purpose and leaning of life.</p><p>The dominant image is that of the athlete being chaired shoulder-high and basking in the cheers of the spectators s he receives the laurel which is a classical symbol of success.</p><p>The above image contrasts with another, the \"road where all runners come\" which is death. Death is presented in .Tier images like \"a stiller town\", which is the cemetery where \"silence sounds no worse than cheers; \"home\" which suggests finality, and \"shady night\". All these stand in opposition to the image of the laurel and the rose, which, though marking earthly success and beauty, wither so fast. It is remarkable, therefore, that the athlete is described as \"smart lad\" to have died young before beauty and access desert him.</p><p>In the poem, images are turned upon their heads. For example, the image of the lad being carried \"shoulder high\" as a mark of worldly success is the same image presented of him being carried \"shoulder high\" this time, towards his save. Similarly, the garland that withers where \"lads wore their honors out\" is described as \"unwithered\" on the head of tie \"strengthless dead\".</p><p>Reference can also be made to the image of the \"challenge cup\" which lures athletes into the limelight, \"the market Face\". There, if they do not \"retire\" as quickly as the \"smart lad\" they will face, in the language and feeling of the poet, disappointment and disgrace, being 'lads that wore their honours out. / Runners whom renown outran / And the name died before the man.\" However, for the \"smart lad\" who dies at the height of his achievement, there is the \"still defended challenge cup\". </p>",

        "answer": "<p>The theme of rejected love is more implied than stated in the poem. What the poem presents, essentially, is a scene where the persona attempts to woo his mistress into having a sexual relationship with him.</p><p>In stanza after stanza, the persona conjures up different types of images, first to ease his mistress's fears by suggesting that time and distance are not of the essence in their love relationship and he can afford to sit by \"the tide/ Of Humber and complain while she refuses\" \"Till\" the conversion of the Jews\" and he spends countless number of years adoring the physical features of his mistress.</p><p>When his mistress does not appear to have been moved, the persona invokes the spectre of death in stanza 2, with \"Time's winged chariot hurrying near\". Other images associated with the grave and decay are made use of, and the mistress is reminded of her own mortality and the work that worms will do to her virginity if she does not give in to his sexual overtures.</p><p>Since this may appear to have frightened his mistress enough, the persona argues in the 3rd stanza that now is time for them to consummate their love, for the \"youthful hue/sits on thy skin like morning dew\" and her body and senses seem aroused.</p><p>Throughout the poem, though, it is only the persona who speaks, pleads, coaxes and threatens.

        "answer": "<p>In The Joys of Motherhood, women are not only barely tolerated, they are discriminated against. A woman is supposed to be seen and not heard. Women are regarded as child producing machines only, and do not have any rights of their own. That is why a woman is not fulfilled until she gets married and is able to produce children. Where she brings forth female children only, her chance of retaining her position in the man's house is reduced. And where she fails to produce a child, she is regarded as a total failure. But, when a woman brings forth a male child, she is celebrated, not only by the husband, but by the entire family and the community at large.</p><p>Nnu Ego epitomizes the disadvantaged position of women in the novel. She is reduced to a housemaid in the house of Amatokwu, her first husband, because of her inability to produce a child. She is relegated to the background and saddled with the task of taking care of the home while her co-wife is showered with attention and accorded special treatment because she has a child.</p><p>In Nnaife's house, Nnu Ego's hope of womanhood is revived, but this is dashed when Ngozi, her first child, dies and she regards herself as a failed woman. Her joy is resuscitated at the birth of a boy. Nnu Ego feels happy and her relationship with her husband improves. When the husband is conscripted into the' army, it is Nnu Ego that is saddled with the responsibility of taking care of the children. Making ends meet is almost a nightmare. Unfortunately, when Nnaife returns from Fernando Po, he chooses to acquire more wives without even consulting her, thereby compounding their financial problems. Nnaife behaves like this because he is a man. </p><p>When Kehinde, Nnu Ego's daughter, refuses to accept the husband chosen for her by her father, Nnaife becomes very annoyed. Rather than face the situation squarely, he chooses to heap the blame on Nnu Ego.</p><p>Adaku, the other wife is also a victim of gender discrimination. All her children are females. On reporting a case of indignity suffered by her visitor at the hands of Nnu Ego to Nwakusor, Nnaife's friend, Nwakusor reminds Adaku that the only way a man gets immortalized is by having a son. He says to her \"I know you have children, but they are girls, who in a few years' time will go and help build another man's immortality\".</p><p>Nnu Ego's claim to the house is based on her bringing forth Adim and Oshia. Ironically, her male children prove irresponsible but her daughters and their husbands are those who give her support financially.</p><p>Gender discrimination is entrenched in the society. Even children are encouraged to believe that the male is superior to the female. Oshia, for example, refuses to help the girls fetch water because, as he puts it, \"I am a boy\". Rather than scold him, all the people around merely laugh. This shows the acquiescence of even the women, pointing to the general acceptance of gender discrimination.</p><p>Nwokocha Abgadi's behaviour to his wives is a good example of the way the female gender is treated. In total disregard for the feelings of his wives, he makes love to Ona in his compound, surrounded by his family. His impatience at Agunwa's jealous reaction which apparently leads to her sickness and eventual death, is an indication of the discrimination which the female gender faces. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ISIDORE OKPEWHO: The Last Duty </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the view that Aku is a tragic character. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Aku's position in The Last Duty is pathetic. Reduced to penury by Oshevire's detention, she finds herself confronted with the proposals of Chief Toje, Oshevire's rival and accuser. Her tragedy in the novel is that in spite of her effort to preserve her dignity, she finds herself slipping down the abyss into sexual infidelity and disgrace.</p><p>Aku's situation is indeed a difficult one. Her deprived condition clearly illustrates the disastrous consequences of the war on individuals. It is this deprivation which makes her easy prey for Toje's unscrupulous exploitation. Right from the start she is aware of her disadvantaged condition and acknowledges it quite readily. Despite her expressed fears. she resigns herself to her fate. She admits that even though deprived of food and comfort, she has in fact realized what Toje is after. Whenever she goes on her tryst with him, she is full of guilt.</p><p>Paradoxically, it is her sexual, not economic, deprivation which leads to her loss of integrity. After Toje's impotent attempt to make love to her, she is sexually aroused and craves satisfaction. She thus turns her attention to Odibo whose vibrant sexuality she has only just become aware of. Aku's attempt to justify her behaviour carries with it a certain element of pathos. Tortured, tormented, driven almost to the limits of human endurance, she finds herself wishing that Toje could make love to her, repugnant though the thought is. The reality of sin would at least be better than the fantasy which Toje is dragging her through. This prepares the way for Odibo's subsequent love-making with her.</p><p>In Aku, we see the result of a war which unjustly deprives a family of its breadwinner, and a woman the right to love and enjoy sex with her husband. Her predicament also demonstrates the insecurity, both physical and emotional, consequent upon a civil' war. Her relationship with her husband cannot remain in the same state after the scandal. Oshevire is released from prison in time to face the disgrace after the fight between Toje and Odibo over his wife.</p><p>The tragic end of Oshevire's life results directly from his attempt to leave the scene of his disgrace occasioned by the infidelity of his wife. This serves to further deepen Aku's tragedy.</p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>AFRICAN PROSE</strong></p><p><strong>ISIDORE OKPEWHO: The Last Duty </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the horrors of war in the novel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The horrors of war in the novel are presented through the experiences of different characters in the story. The most obvious consequence of war is the general state of insecurity which it creates. This is seen for example in the persistent air raids reported in the novel. Many civilians lose their lives and property and those who survive are emotionally traumatized.</p><p>They are uneasy because aircraft guns boom everywhere. Major Ali is welcome as a commander who is around to ensure the safety of the people. His men use anti-aircraft guns to bring down rebel planes that are causing destruction and suffering on the people. Members of the Red Cross have to cope with the injured and displaced in the community.</p><p>Another example of the horrible consequences of war is the conscription of young men into the army. Young men who could have lived peacefully now find themselves being forced into fighting in the war.</p><p>Civilians find themselves at the mercy of soldiers who believe that they are all powerful and can do whatever they like. An illustration of this is seen in Private Sule who kills his girlfriend and rival in a fit of jealousy.</p><p>He is executed in public for his crime. It is the war which has created the situation in which Private Sule could have the guts to commit such a crime. It is the same war that permits a public execution for such a crime. The summary execution without due process shows that the war situation permits summary executions.</p><p>The atmosphere of insecurity in a war situation is accentuated by the detention of civilians on spurious charges. Oshevire's predicament offers a good example. He is detained unlawfully for three years during which period instances of brutality suffered by prisoners are highlighted.</p><p>Oshevire's wife and son are reduced to penury and consequently exposed to the whims and caprices of their supposed benefactor, Toje. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>RICHARD WRIGHT: Black Boy </strong></p><p> </p><p>Discuss the relationship between Richard and the members of his family.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",
        "answer": "<p>The relationship between Richard and memebrs of his family-his mother, father, grandparents, uncles and aunts plays a significant role in his life. Richard's relationship with his mother is very close. She does beat him mercilessly when he misbehaves but Richard realizes that she does not do it out of spite. He really loves her and takes up a job to fend for her when she suffers a stroke even though he is merely a boy. The incident in which Richard encounters the boys on his way to the grocery is an example.</p><p>She prepares him for life in the violent society in which they live. Richard's father is the exact opposite of the mother. There is mutual hatred between them as is manifested in the kitten incident. His father also treats him brutally as illustrated in the incident in which Richard sets their house on fire. The father ends up abandoning his family with total disregard for the hunger and deprivation which this will cause.</p><p>Richard's grandmother in her obsession with religion regards him as a wayward child and treats him as such. She stifles his physical and emotional growth. She prevents him from working on Saturday and whenever he steps out of line, she punishes him severely.</p><p>Aunt Addie sees him as a constant threat to all authority and takes every opportunity to subjugate him through punishment. This awakens the rebellious streak in Richard and he resorts to using a knife to threaten her. The effect which Aunt Addle has on Rithard is not much different from that which Uncle Tom has on him. Uncle Tom's persistent caning of Richard forces the boy to engage in violence.</p><p>Apart from Richard's mother, the only members of his family who treat him like a human being are Aunt Maggie and Uncle Hoskins. They cater for both his physical and emotional needs. Unfortunately, this relationship is cut short by the murder of Uncle Hoskins. </p>",

        "question": "<p><strong>NON-AFRICAN PROSE </strong></p><p><strong>RICHARD WRIGHT: Black Boy </strong></p><p> </p><p>Comment on the theme of racism in the novel. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>Racism is predominant in Black Boy. The treatment of the blacks by the whites is primarily determined by the colour of their skin. This defines all relationship between whites and blacks in the novel. Blacks are regarded as no better than second class citizens in the society.</p><p>There are many instances of racism in the novel. Richard's grandfather serves in the army during the civil war b is denied his pension till he dies. It is clear from the novel that had he been white, he would not have been treated that way.</p><p>Richard himself suffers because of the practice of racism. One day when he is at work, he is bitten by a dog Instead of taking him to a doctor for treatment, his white boss dismisses his complaint with the statement that a dog bite does not hurt a 'nigger'. Richard's treatment when he is working at the optician's and his fight with Harrison on tf. instigation of the whites, for their own pleasure, are examples of racism as it affects Richard.</p><p>Blacks are deprived of equal educational opportunities. They are denied the pleasure of reading books, and access to health facilities and good jobs. Even where they achieve success through sheer hard work and make laudable achievements, they are not allowed to reap the benefits of their labour. Thus Uncle Hoskins is brutally murdered mere because he is prosperous. His family is even denied the opportunity to bury his corpse honourably.</p><p>When a black woman inadvertently trespasses on white property she is mercilessly beaten up. Whites do hesitate to brutalize blacks for not addressing them 'sir' when talking with them.</p><p>Other instances of racism abound in the novel, such as the different queues for blacks and whites in the tra station and the killing of Ned's brother, Bob.</p><p>The dominant impression in the novel is that blacks are dehumanized because of the racist attitude of whites. </p>",
