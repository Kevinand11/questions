        "question": "<p><em>Outline the contribution of Ibn Khaldin to Islam.</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>He received a classical Arabic education, studying the Quran and Arabic linguistics, the basis for an understanding of the Quran and of Islamic law, Hadith and Fiqh. The philosopher Al-Alibi introduced him to mathematics, logic and philosophy. At the age of 17, Ibn Khaldun lost both his parents to an epidemic of the plague, which hit Tunis. At the age of 20, he began his political career at the Chancellery of the Tunisian ruler, Ibn Tafrakin, with the position of Katib al-‘alamah, which consisted of writing in fine calligraphy the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, 5 Abu Zaid, the Sultan of Constantine, marched on Tunis, and defeated it. Ibn Khaldun’s thirst for advanced knowledge and a better academic setting soon made him leave this service and migrate to Fez. He was the ambassador of the Sultan of Granada to Pedro the Cruel, the Christian king of Castile in 1363. Although once imprisoned for nearly two years, he was blessed with good luck and traveled extensively at a time when few people could find the means to do so. Soon after his entire family died in a shipwreck, he made the Hajj to Makkah. In 1377, in the short period of five months, he wrote the Muqadimmah (or Prolegomena) while secluded at a palace of Sultan Abu Hamu near Tujin (Enan, 1975). Although he added to his work over the next five years, the whirlwinds of political change and courtly intrigue compelled him to set aside his Prolegomena and move to Cairo, where he became a noted professor, judge and sheikh (manager) of Baybars, the greatest Sufi institution of that age. His final work, an autobiography, has yet to be translated into English. Since Ibn Khaldun’s life was so thoroughly connected to historical events, his theory organically links the realms of ideas and actions. Thus to pose the categories of his thought in the scholastic tradition of Western philosophy (particularly the idealism/ materialism schism) completely fails to deal with the unity of these domains in Ibn Khaldun’s system. The prevalence with which Europeans have compared Ibn Khaldun to Western scholars has led Franz Rosenthal, Ibn Khaldun’s translator and one of the principal Arabist scholars in the United States, to coin the term ‘forerunner syndrome’ to describe and simultaneously criticize this tendency (Bruce, 1984). Praise, too, can be a means of obscuring the contributions of Ibn Khaldun. In his three volumes Study of History, Arnold Toynbee calls Ibn Khaldun’s philosophy of history ‘the greatest work of its kind that has ever been created by any mind in any time or place’. For Toynbee, Ibn Khaldun was the ‘sole point of light’ and ‘the one outstanding personality’ of Islamic thought, absurd ideas that illustrate centuries of the West’s utter disregard of Islamic intellectual tradition. His cultural context incapacitated Toynbee, but his own system places Ibn Khaldun within the prevailing Western viewpoint that modern history begins with the Renaissance, an assumption that clearly transposes Western historical conditions onto world history. During the same century that Ibn Khaldun lived, there was not one Christian Arabic scholar in Europe (Southern, 1962). Long before Europeans became acquainted with Muslim thought, Turkish scholars delighted in the treasures they found accessible to them. Despite Europes’s ignorance, Europeans ‘discovered’ the importance of Ibn Khaldun in the nineteenth century, thereby elevating his status from just another ‘footnote to Islamic historiography…. as the foremost Muslim historian of Ibn Khaldun’. M. Talbi remarked, ‘It was in Europe that Ibn Khaldun was discovered and the importance of his Mukaddima realized.’ (Bruce 1984). Once the thought of Ibn Khaldun became known in Europe, however, a growing list of admirers appeared, and fawning admiration and inclination toward the appropriation of Ibn Khaldun into a preexisting system of Eurocentric categories accelerated.</p>",

        "question": "<p><em>Describe how Muhammad (S. A. W) became a prophet</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>Muhammad was very religious, occasionally taking journeys of devotion to sacred sites near Mecca. On one of his pilgrimages in 610, he was meditating in a cave on Mount Jabal aI-Nour. The Angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God: “Recite in the name of your Lord who creates, creates man from a clot! Recite for your lord is most generous….” These words became the opening verses of sūrah (chapter) 96 of the Qur'an. Most Islamic historians believe Muhammad was initially disturbed by the revelations and that he didn’t reveal them publicly for several years. However, Shi’a tradition states he welcomed the message from the Angel Gabriel and was deeply inspired to share his experience with other potential believers.</p><p>Islamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca’s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad’s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca’s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused.</p><p>Increasingly, the resistance to Muhammed and his followers grew and they were eventually forced to emigrate from Mecca to Medina, a city 260 miles to the north in 622. This event marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. There Muhammad was instrumental in bringing an end to a civil war raging amongst several of the city’s tribes. Muhammad settled in Medina, building his Muslim community and gradually gathering acceptance and more followers.</p><p>Between 624 and 628, the Muslims were involved in a series of battles for their survival. In the final major confrontation, The Battle of the Trench and Siege of Medina, Muhammad and his followers prevailed and a treaty was signed. The treaty was broken by the Meccan allies a year later. By now, Muhammad had plenty of forces and the balance of power had shifted away from the Meccan leaders to him. In 630, the Muslim army marched into Mecca, taking the city with minimum casualties. Muhammad gave amnesty to many of the Meccan leaders who had opposed him and pardoned many others. Most of the Meccan population converted to Islam. Muhammad and his followers then proceeded to destroy all of the statues of pagan gods in and around the Kaaba.</p>",

        "question": "<p><em>Explain the reason for the standardization of the Qur’a</em><em>̄n</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim\">Muslim</a> belief and Islamic scholarly accounts, the revelation of the Qur'an began in 610 AD when the angel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel\">Gabriel</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language\">Arabic</a>: جبريل, <em>Jibrīl</em> or جبرائيل, <em>Jabrāʾīl</em>) appeared to Muhammad in the cave <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Hira\">Hira</a> near <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca\">Mecca</a>, reciting to him the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayat\">verses</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surah\">Surah</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Alaq\">Al-Alaq</a>. Muslims believe that Muhammad continued to have revelations for the rest of life until his death in 632 AD.According to Islamic tradition, the Qur'an was first compiled into a book format by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Thabit\">Zayd ibn Thabit</a> and other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe\">scribes</a> under the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph\">caliph</a> — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr_Siddiq\">Abu Bakr Siddiq</a>. As the Islamic Empire began to grow, and differing recitations were heard in far-flung areas, the Quran was recompiled for uniformity in recitation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.#Historiography\">r.</a> 644–56). under the direction of the third <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph\">caliph</a> — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uthman\">Uthman ibn Affan</a>. For this reason, the Qur'an as it exists today is also known as the Uthmanic codex. According to Professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Edward_Peters\">Francis Edward Peters</a> (1991), what was done to the Quran in the process seems to have been extremely conservative and the content was formed in a mechanical fashion to avoid redactional bias.</p>",

        "question": "<p><em>Discuss the contribution of Imam at-Tirmidhi to the development of science of  Hadith.</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>An-Nabawiyyah wa Al-Fada‘il Al-Mustafawiyyah), a compilation of hadiths concerning the person and character of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. At-Tirmidhi was also well versed in Arabic grammar, favoring the school of Kufa over Basra due to the former's preservation of Arabic poetry as a primary source . ―Al-`Ilal As-Sughra‖, ―Az-Zuhd‖, ―Al-`Ilal Al-Kubra‖, ―Al-Asmaa‘ wa Al-Kuna‖, ―Kitab al-Tarikh‖ were written by Abu Isa Tirmidhi as well . B. “Al-Jami’ as-Sahih”: Publications and Commentaries ―Al-Jami` as-Sahih‖ is one of the most important book in Sunni Islamic world. According to the historian Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, al-Tirmidhi wrote this work in 270 AH (884 AH), when he was about sixty years of age, after having gained considerable experience in science and becoming an imam . Manuscripts of this work have been preserved in many cities around the world, as well as in the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, Oriental Studies Institute named after Abu Raykhan Beruni. ―Al-Jami` as-Sahih‖ has been repeatedly published as an important source. For instance, it was published in Mitoh 1283 (1866), Cairo in 1292 (1875), and in Beirut in 1980. Several commentaries were written for this work such as ―Aridhat al-Ahwathi bi Sharh Sunan al-Tirmidhi‖ by Ibn al-Arabi (d. 543H )(1148-49 CE), ―Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi‖ of which only the last portion of remains – ―Sharh 'Ilal at-Tirmidhi‖ by Ibn Rajab, ―Commentary on al-Tirmidhi's Hadith Collection‖ by al-Zayn al-Iraqi, Footnotes, including explanation and verification, of approximately the first third of the Sunan by Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, ―Al-ʿUrf al Shadhi Sharh Sunan Al-Tirmidhi‖ by Anwar Shah Kashmiri, ―Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi Bi Sharh Jamiʿ Al-Tirmidhi‖ by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Mubarkafuri, ―Fuyoodh Un Nabi, Sharh Jami Al Tirmidhi‖ (in Urdu Language) by 'Allama Mufti Muhammad Arshad ul Qadri' . C. Structure and contents It should be mentioned that the third century of the Hijri (ninth century AD) is a golden period in the development of hadith science. The fruitful work of such scholars as Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim, who lived and worked at that time, is of great importance. Abu Isa Tirmidhi made a great contribution to the hadith science which was started collecting and sorted by his teachers: Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim. He became one of the most influential scholars in the Muslim world. ―Al-Jami` as-Sahih‖ plays an important role in hadith [4]. The author divides his work into separate chapters and, whenever possible, quotes each hadith. After each hadith, it specifies the degree of reliability or weakness. Earlier we mentioned that the work was called ―Al-Sunan‖ (―Sunan at-Termizi‖). One of the main reasons for this name is that it contains a great deal of hadiths concerning fiqh. In addition, there are many hadiths about discipline, ethics, and good manners in the work, and it is not an exaggeration to say that hadiths of this level are not found in any author's work. Structurally, the work is divided into the following chapters: purification, salat (prayer), al-witr, the day of Friday, the two eids, traveling, zakat, fasting, hajj, jana'iz (funerals),marriage, suckling, divorce and li'an, s on judgements from the messenger of allah, blood money, legal punishments (al-hudud), hunting, sacrifices, vows and oaths, military expeditions, virtues of jihad, jihad, clothing, food, drinks, righteousness and maintaining good relations with relatives, medicine, inheritance, wasaya (wills and testament), wala' and gifts, al-qadar, al-fitan, dreams, witnesses, zuhd, the description of the day of judgement, ar-riqaq, and al-wara', the description of paradise, the description of hellfire, faith, knowledge, seeking permission, manners, parables, the virtues of the qur'an, recitation, tafsir, supplication. Overall, this work consists of 48 chapters . These chapters are divided into chapters in the title, and the hadiths of the chapter fully reflect the contents of the chapter. The author cites a number of hadiths on the subject of this chapter and then expresses the views of other scholars on the subject</p>",

        "question": "<p><em>Account for the success of the prophet (S.A.W.) in Madina</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>A delegation from Medina, consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the entire community. There was fighting in Yathrib (Medina) mainly involving its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people\">Arab</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews\">Jewish</a> inhabitants for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bu%27ath\">battle of Bu'ath</a> in which all the clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal conceptions of blood-feud and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye\">an eye for an eye</a> were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.</p><p>Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina until virtually all of his followers had left <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca\">Mecca</a>. Being alarmed at the departure of Muslims, according to the tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate him. He instructed his cousin and future son-in-law <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali\">Ali</a> to sleep in his bed to trick the assassins that he had stayed (and to fight them off in his stead) and secretly slipped away from the town. By 622, Muhammad had emigrated to Medina, then known as Yathrib, a large agricultural <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis\">oasis</a>. Following the emigration, the Meccans seized the properties of the Muslim emigrants in Mecca.<br>\nThe first group of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism\">pagan</a> converts to Islam in Medina were the clans who had not produced great leaders for themselves but had suffered from warlike leaders from other clans. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_mythology\">pagan population</a> of Medina, apart from some exceptions. This was, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq\">Ibn Ishaq</a>, influenced by the conversion to Islam of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%27d_ibn_Mua%27dh\">Sa'd ibn Mua'dh</a>, one of the prominent leaders in Medina.Among the things Muhammad did in order to settle the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was drafting a document known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina\">Constitution of Medina</a> (date debated), establishing a kind of brotherhood among the eight Medinan tribes and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhajirun\">Muslim emigrants from Mecca</a>, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including that of the Muslim community to other communities specifically the Jews and other \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book\">Peoples of the Book</a>\"). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah\">umma</a></em>, had a religious outlook but was also shaped by the practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_of_Arabia\">Arab tribes</a>. Muhammad's adoption of facing north towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem\">Jerusalem</a> when performing the daily prayers (<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla\">qibla</a></em>) however need not to necessarily be a borrowing from the Jews as the reports about the direction of prayer before migration to Medina are contradictory and further this direction of prayer was also practiced among other groups in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula\">Arabia</a>.</p>",
