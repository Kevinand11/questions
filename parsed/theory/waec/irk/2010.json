        "question": "<p><em>Highlight the difficult times in the early life of Muhammad (S. A. W) before his prophethood</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>Muhammad was born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). His father died before he was born and he was raised first by his grandfather and then his uncle. He belonged to a poor but respectable family of the Quraysh tribe. The family was active in Meccan politics and trade.</p><p>Many of the tribes living in the Arabian Peninsula at the time were nomadic, trading goods as they crisscrossed the desert. Most tribes were polytheistic, worshipping their own set of gods. The town of Mecca was an important trading and religious center, home to many temples and worship sites where the devoted prayed to the idols of these gods. The most famous site was the Kaaba (meaning cube in Arabic). It is believed to have been built by Abraham (Ibrahim to Muslims) and his son Ismail. Gradually the people of Mecca turned to polytheism and idolatry. Of all the gods worshipped, it is believed that Allah was considered the greatest and the only one without an idol.</p><p>In his early teens, Muhammad worked in a camel caravan, following in the footsteps of many people his age, born of meager wealth. Working for his uncle, he gained experience in commercial trade traveling to Syria and eventually from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. In time, Muhammad earned a reputation as honest and sincere, acquiring the nickname “al-Amin” meaning faithful or trustworthy.</p><p>In his early 20s, Muhammad began working for a wealthy merchant woman named Khadijah, 15 years his senior. She soon became attracted to this young, accomplished man and proposed marriage. He accepted and over the years the happy union brought several children. Not all lived to adulthood, but one, Fatima, would marry Muhammad’s cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom Shi’ite Muslims regard as Muhammad’s successor.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>In its classic form a <strong>hadith</strong> has two <strong>parts</strong>—the chain of narrators who have transmitted the report (the isnad), and the main text of the report (the matn). Individual <strong>hadith</strong> are classified by Muslim clerics and jurists into categories such as sahih (\"authentic\"), hasan (\"good\") or da'if (\"weak\").</p>",

        "question": "<p><em>Let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day .............................. </em>\" <em>(Hadith </em>15 <em>of an-Nawawi).</em></p><p><em>(a) Complete the Hadith.</em></p><p><em>(b) Explain its lessons</em></p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) \"Let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good, or keep silent; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his neighbour; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his guest.\"</p><p>(b) <strong><em>Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day…”</em></strong></p><p>In this hadith, Prophet mentions 3 features that need to be a part of a Muslim’s character in order for him to complete his/her faith/imaan. Therefore, if you find yourself lacking in these qualities, this hadith should serve as a reminder and a reality check, helping you reassess and refine your goals to be the best version of yourself.</p><h3><strong>So, why it the Last Day mentioned?</strong></h3><p>This serves as an encouragement and pushes you to strive to be the best Muslim you can be, because every single aspect of your life will be questioned on the Day of Judgment, including how you treated others and how you carried yourself in this dunya.</p><p><strong><em>“…should speak good things or keep silent…”</em></strong></p><p>The first part is concerned with how we use our tongue. Needless to say, majority of problems we face is due to incorrect usage of tongue, a part of your body that needs to be guarded at all times. It’s no secret that excessive speech will always lead to problems and misunderstandings that would have never crept up in the first place, if only we thought twice before opening our mouths. Our speech is one of the quickest ways for us to collect unwanted sins or blessings depending on how we choose to use it. So next time, you’re about to talk, ask yourself:</p><ul>\n<li>Will my speech by pleasing to Allah?</li>\n<li>Is it absolutely necessary to talk?</li>\n<li>Will I be overstepping my boundaries if I say such-and-such thing?</li>\n<li>Will this speech cause happiness and bring about good will or will it cause souring of relationships and create bad blood?</li>\n</ul><p>Of course, you need not limit yourself to these set of questions. There are many more aspects which you can assess for yourself before talking.</p><p>Umar r.a. once said,</p><p><strong><em>“The one who speaks a lot commits lots of mistakes. The one who makes lots of mistakes commits lots of sins. The one who commits lots of sins will have the Hell-fire as the first place for him.”</em></strong>(Ibn Rajab)</p><h3><strong>Therefore, use your speech to:</strong></h3><ul>\n<li>Correct people when they commit mistakes or are straying away from the path of Allah</li>\n<li>Prevent people from committing sins</li>\n<li>Set relationships right for the greater good</li>\n<li>Guide others towards righteousness</li>\n</ul><h3><strong>And remain silent so that you…</strong></h3><ul>\n<li>Don’t spread false information about others</li>\n<li>Don’t lie, it may be tempting but the side effects are much worse than what you could have imagined.</li>\n<li>Don’t backbite: Refrain; refrain from it as much as you can!</li>\n<li>Don’t speak about this deen when you don’t have sufficient knowledge to do so</li>\n</ul><h3><strong><em>“…should be courteous and generous to his neighbor…”</em></strong></h3><p>With advancement in technology, we have become obsessed with our gadgets, smartphones and laptops, so much so that we don’t spend enough time with our own family members, let alone visiting and checking out on our neighbors. This hadith is a timely reminder sent by our beloved Prophet himself, insisting on how our conduct should be with our neighbors, irrespective of whether they are Muslims or not:</p><h2><strong>What you can do:</strong></h2><ul>\n<li>Smile: Yes, smile at your neighbors and those around you, not only is it sunnah, but smiling is the fastest way to cement and bond and relationship that can last a lifetime. Initiate this beautiful sunnah of our Prophet.</li>\n<li>Ask if they need any kind of assistance.</li>\n<li>Visit them when they are ill.</li>\n<li>Prepare nice food for them.</li>\n<li>Be the kind of person whom they are delighted to meet and greet when they see you.</li>\n</ul><p>Abu Bakr al-Jazairi (reference: Minhaaj al-Muslim) goes on to add:</p><ul>\n<li>Congratulate them if something pleasing occurs to them,</li>\n<li>Offer condolences upon afflictions,</li>\n<li> Help them if they are in need,</li>\n<li> Be the first to greet them,</li>\n<li>Be kind in speech to them,</li>\n<li>Be gentle in one’s speech to the neighbor’s children,</li>\n<li>Guide them to what is best for their religion and worldly life,</li>\n<li>Overlook their mistakes,</li>\n<li> Don’t attempt to look into their private matters,</li>\n<li>Don’t constraint them with your building or renovations or along the walkway,</li>\n<li>Don’t harm them by letting one’s trash onto their property or in front of their household.</li>\n</ul><p>The Prophet said: “Jibreel (as) did not cease to advise me regarding the rights of the neighbor, until I began to think that they would also receive a part of the inheritance”. [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p><p>These small steps can bring tremendous rewards from Allah, so start practicing them now!</p><h3><strong><em>“…should be courteous and generous to his [traveling] visitor”</em></strong></h3><p>Here, we are being commanded to be courteous and generous to a traveling person who has left his belongings/family/property in search of whatever he/she is traveling for. So how does a Muslim treat a traveler who is in a foreign land and could be extremely apprehensive because he knows no one?</p><ul>\n<li>By being kind towards him</li>\n<li>Ask what his needs are and try your best to fulfill them</li>\n<li>Prepare the best of food and give it to them, without extravagance</li>\n</ul><p>The scholars say “Belief is what settles in the heart and manifests itself on one’s limbs” therefore, if you truly have faith in your heart, these actions and a whole lot of righteous deeds will automatically flow through your limbs and tongue! And if they don’t, don’t worry, ask Allah to make you a beautiful person inside out!</p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>Gabriel (PBUH): The Archangel (A.S)</strong></p><p>Gabriel (A.S) is one of the four greatest angels. He is appointed to convey revelations to the prophets by Allah. In three places of the Qur’an, His name is Jibril. Besides, He is mentioned in verses as the spirit, rasulun karim, ruh al-Amin and ruh al-qudus”. In addition to these, in one of the hadiths, he is called “an-namus”.</p><p><strong>The Angel of Soor (The Trumpet): Hz. Israfel (A.S)</strong></p><p>The angel that will blow the trumpet is called Israfel. His name is mentioned among the four great angels in the hadiths. Israfel will blow two times, in the first one, the Doomsday will occur and in the second blowing, the resurrection will occur. Because of this duty of him, He is called the angel of Soor (the Trumpet). When the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was asked about the nature of the trumpet, he answered: “A horn that is blown” (Ahmad b. Hanbal, II, 196).</p><p>The prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said that “Israfel is awaiting the order of blowing while He grasps the trumpet”. (Tabari Jami-ul Bayan, VII, 211; Ibn Kathir, Tafsiru’l-Qur’an-il Azim, Egypt, n.d. II, 276)</p><p><strong>The Angel of Death: Hz. Azrael (A.S)</strong></p><p>His duty is to grasp the souls of people whose death times have come. He is called as “Malak-ul Mawt”, that is, the angel of death.</p><p><em>Say: <strong>\"The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls: then shall ye be brought back to your Lord.\" </strong>(Surah as-Sajda)</em></p><p><strong>The Angel that controls the events in this realm: Hz. Mikail (A.S) (Michael)</strong></p><p>He is one of the greatest angels of four and He is responsible for the pouring of rain, the blowing of the wind, natural events such as the ordering of seasons and the management of supplications of the created beings. He is only mentioned in one place of the Qur’an. Hz. Mikail is the angel that manages the divine work of arts that are planted on the field of earth with the power of Allah and His order.</p><p><strong>The angels of Kiraman Katibin</strong></p><p>It is the names of the angels who are attendant on the right and left of humans. The angel on the right is responsible for recording the good deeds and manners; the angel on the left is responsible for recording the bad deeds and manners. “The angels who are also called Hafaza will attend as witnesses of the deeds of humans in the Day of Judgment during reckoning.</p>",
