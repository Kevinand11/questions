        "question": "<p>Describe how I;tikāf is observed with emphasis on acts that vitiate it</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Itikaf is considered to be a type of spiritual retreat. During the last 10 days of Ramadan, many Muslims spend their days and nights at the mosque (masjid) in order to ensure that they are there for whichever night Laylat al-Qadr occurs. This is called itikaf. Literally translated, it is an Arabic word that means \"to isolate oneself and to stick or adhere to something.\"</p><h2>Three Types of Itikaf</h2><ol>\n<li><strong>Sunnah:</strong> This is the itikaf performed during the last 10 days of Ramadan.</li>\n<li><strong>Nafl:</strong> Itikaf can be performed on any day/night of the year. This is considered to be a nafl (voluntary) act.</li>\n<li><strong>Wajib:</strong> If you have made a vow to perform itikaf, then it is compulsory (wajib) that you do so. This could be making a vow to Allah, such as through niyyat (intention) to perform itikaf or a vow based on a condition. This means saying or thinking: \"If this thing happens, I will make itikaf for certain number of days.\"</li>\n</ol><p>As far as when a person should begin his or her itikaf, there seems to be a variance in opinion as well. There are a few hadiths that mention that the Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) would begin his itikaf at the time of Maghrib prayer, and many hadiths that mention that he would begin his itikaf at the time of Fajr prayer. So it depends upon the believer and his or her intentions.</p><p>If the intention is there to do so, itikaf could last only a few hours. For example, it is encouraged, but not mandatory, to be in a state of itikaf during the time of Fajr until the sun rises and to be in a state of itikaf from Maghrib until the end of Isha prayer.</p><h2>What Are the Conditions of Itikaf?</h2><ul>\n<li><strong>Being Muslim:</strong> The first condition to performing itikaf is that the person be Muslim. Also, note that children who have not reached an age of discernment (<em>sin at-tamyiz</em>) do not participate in itikaf. The child must be able to eat, dress themselves, and wash themselves without assistance. For those who follow the Hanafi school of thought, this is typically around the age of seven for boys and around the age of nine for girls.</li>\n<li><strong>Must be of sound mind:</strong> What this means is that a person must be able to make reasonable and rational thoughts and decisions. To explain further, a person may not be drunk or under the influence of drugs that may alter their state of mind. Also, a person who has a mental illness where they cannot make decisions on their own does not perform itikaf.</li>\n<li><strong>Niyyah:</strong> This means intention. One must have the intention to participate in itikaf for the sake of Allah, not for the sake of being seen by others. Your intention must be pure and focused on worshiping and pleasing Allah.</li>\n<li><strong>Permission:</strong> Women need to ask permission from their husbands before performing itikaf.</li>\n<li><strong>Performed in masjid:</strong> It is mentioned in <a href=\"https://quran.com/2/187\" onclick=\"if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\" data-cf-modified-e6954baf892bc19b6cd5160c-=\"\">Surat al-Baqarah 2:187</a> that itikaf is performed in a masjid. While some may say it is okay to perform itikaf at home, especially for women, most scholars agree that this is simply not the case at all, because the Qur'an says otherwise.</li>\n<li><strong>State of wudu:</strong> One must be in a state of wudu (purification/cleanliness) to participate in itikaf. If a person's wudu is nullified, such as using the bathroom, then the person must wudu before continuing itikaf. Although, if during sleep, one has what is called a wet dream, one's itikaf is not nullified but one must ghusl (full body purification) before continuing itikaf.</li>\n<li><strong>Fasting:</strong> By most schools of thought, fasting is a requirement to perform itikaf. Itikaf is mentioned in the Qur'an in conjunction to the fasting of Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) would always fast during the time of his itikaf. However, some believe that if a person has a medical condition, such as diabetes, that prevents him or her from fasting, that it is still permissible for that person to participate in itikaf. Please note that a medical condition differs from being ill, such as with fever or nausea.</li>\n</ul>",

        "question": "<p>Write on Muhammad (S.A W) from birth to prophethood (610 CE)</p>",
        "answer": "<p> </p><p>Muhammad is born as a member of the tribe of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Quraysh\">Quraysh</a> and the clan of Hāshim. His hometown of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Mecca\">Mecca</a> houses an ancient and famous pilgrimage sanctuary, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kaaba-shrine-Mecca-Saudi-Arabia\">Kaʿbah</a>. Although founded by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraham\">Abraham</a>, worship there has over time become dominated by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/polytheism\">polytheism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/idolatry\">idolatry</a>. Muhammad’s <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception\">conception</a> is preceded by a dramatic crisis: his grandfather ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib narrowly fails to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement\">implement</a> a vow to sacrifice his favourite son and Muhammad’s future father, ʿAbd Allāh, an obvious <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adaptation\">adaptation</a> of the biblical story of the binding of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac\">Isaac</a> (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Genesis-Old-Testament\">Genesis</a> 22). Muhammad himself is born in 570, the same year in which the South Arabian king <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraha\">Abraha</a> attempts to conquer Mecca and is thwarted by a divine intervention later <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alluded\">alluded</a> to in sūrah 105 of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Quran\">Qurʾān</a>. Muhammad’s father passes away before his birth, leaving him in the care of his paternal grandfather, ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib. At the age of six Muhammad also loses his mother Āminah, and at eight he loses his grandfather. Thereupon responsibility for Muhammad is assumed by the new head of the clan of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hashimite\">Hāshim</a>, his uncle Abū Ṭālib. While accompanying his uncle on a trading journey to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Syria\">Syria</a>, Muhammad is recognized as a future prophet by a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity\">Christian</a> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/monk-monasticism\">monk</a>.</p><p>At the age of 25, Muhammad is employed by a rich woman, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Khadijah\">Khadījah</a>, to oversee the transportation of her merchandise to Syria. He so impresses her that she offers marriage. Khadījah is said to have been about 40, but she bears Muhammad at least two sons, who die young, and four daughters. The best known of the latter is <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fatimah\">Fāṭimah</a>, the future wife of Muhammad’s cousin <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ali-Muslim-caliph\">ʿAlī</a>, whom <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shii\">Shiʿi</a> Muslims regard as Muhammad’s divinely ordained successor. Until Khadījah’s death some three years before Muhammad’s emigration (<em>hijrah</em>) to Medina in 622, Muhammad takes no other wife, even though <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/polygamy-marriage\">polygamy</a> is common.</p><p>Muhammad’s prophetic initiation occurs at the age of 40. During a period of devotional withdrawal atop one of the mountains in the vicinity of Mecca, the angel <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gabriel-archangel\">Gabriel</a> appears to him in an awe-inspiring encounter and teaches him the opening verses of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/surah\">sūrah</a> 96 of the Qurʾān: “Recite in the name of your Lord who creates, / creates man from a clot! / Recite for your lord is most generous….” Muhammad is greatly perturbed after this first revelation but is reassured by Khadījah and her cousin, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Waraqah-ibn-Nawfal\">Waraqah ibn Nawfal</a>, a learned Christian who confirms Muhammad’s prophetic status. Muhammad continues to receive revelations but for three years limits himself to speaking about them in private. When God finally commands him to take up public preaching, he initially encounters no opposition. However, after the Qurʾānic proclamations begin to deny the existence of gods other than <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Allah\">Allāh</a> and thereby to attack the religious beliefs and practices of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Quraysh\">Quraysh</a> tribe, tensions arise between Muhammad and his small circle of adherents, on the one hand, and the remaining inhabitants of Mecca, on the other. As a result, some of Muhammad’s followers are forced to seek temporary refuge with the Christian ruler of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Ethiopia\">Ethiopia</a>. For some years, the other chief clans of Mecca even refuse to trade and intermarry with Muhammad’s clan, since the latter continues to offer him protection. Sometime after the end of this <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boycott\">boycott</a>, one of the most famous events in the Prophet’s ministry takes place: his so-called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Isra\">Night Journey</a>, during which he is miraculously transported to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Jerusalem\">Jerusalem</a> to pray with Abraham, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Hebrew-prophet\">Moses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus\">Jesus</a>, and other prophets. From there Muhammad continues to ascend to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/heaven\">heaven</a>, where God imposes on him the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pillars-of-Islam\">five daily prayers</a> of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam\">Islam</a>.</p><p>About 619, both Khadījah and Muhammad’s uncle Abū Ṭālib die, and another uncle, Abū Lahab, succeeds to the leadership of the clan of Hāshim. Abū Lahab withdraws the clan’s protection from Muhammad, meaning that the latter can now be attacked without fear of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retribution\">retribution</a> and is therefore no longer safe at Mecca. After failing to win protection in the nearby town of Al-Ṭāʾif, Muhammad secures a pledge of protection from a representative number of the inhabitants of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/oasis-geological-feature\">oasis</a> town of Yathrib, also known as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Medina-Saudi-Arabia\">Medina</a> (from its Qurʾānic appellation <em>al-madīnah</em>, “the town”). This promise enables Muhammad and his followers to leave Mecca for Medina, which, unlike Mecca, is partly inhabited by Jewish tribes. Together with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abu-Bakr\">Abū Bakr</a>, the future first <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/caliph\">caliph</a>, Muhammad is the last to depart. It is only because he is warned by Gabriel that he narrowly escapes an assassination plot by the Quraysh.</p><p>At Medina, Muhammad has a house built that simultaneously serves as a prayer <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/venue\">venue</a> for his followers. He also drafts a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/covenant\">covenant</a> that joins together “the Believers and Submitters [or Muslims] of Quraysh and of Yathrib” as well as some of Medina’s Jewish tribes into a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community\">community</a> (<em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/ummah\">ummah</a></em>) recognizing Muhammad as the “Messenger of God.” However, relations with the Jews of Medina steadily worsen. Eighteen months after the emigration, a revelation bids the Muslims to pray in the direction of the Meccan Kaʿbah, rather than to continue facing toward Jerusalem as is Jewish practice. At about the same time, the Medinan Muslims begin raiding Meccan caravans. When, during one of these raids, they are surprised by a Meccan relief force at Badr in 624, the Muslims, aided by angels, score a surprising victory. In response, the Meccans try to capture Medina, once in 625 in the Battle of Uḥud and again in 627 in the so-called <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-the-Trench\">Battle of the Trench</a>; both attempts to dislodge Muhammad are ultimately unsuccessful. After each of the three major military encounters with the Meccans, Muhammad and his followers manage to oust another of the three main Jewish tribes of Medina. In the case of the last Jewish tribe to be displaced, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Banu-Qurayzah\">Qurayẓah</a>, all adult males are executed, and the women and children are enslaved.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Explain the arrangement of the Qur;ān with emphasis on Makkan and Madinan suwar.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>1. The Makkan Chapters are those which were revealed in Makkah. This refers to everything revealed before the Migration to Madinah, even if the verse was revealed while the Prophet (ﷺ) was outside of the city of Makkah. The Madīnan Chapters are those which were revealed in Madīnah. This refers to everything revealed after the Migration to Madinah, even if the verse was revealed while the Prophet (ﷺ) was outside of the city of Madinah.<br>\n2. The Makkan Chapters are those which were revealed in Makkah. The Madinan Chapters are those which were revealed in Madinah. (See الإتقان في علوم القرآن of As-Suyooti 1/37)<br>\n3. The Makkan Chapters are those which were sent down to address the people of Makkah. The Madinan Chapters are those which were sent down to address the people of Madinah.</p><p>That which is the most popular saying of the scholars is that the distinction between the Makkan and Madīnan verses is based on the time of revelation and not location. So this would indicate that the first definition is most correct.</p><p><strong>Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen mentioned the following points:</strong></p><p><strong>Firstly: The manner of the address of the Quranic verses:</strong></p><p>1. The Makkan verses are distinguished by strength and sternness in addressing the people because the people would turn away and show arrogance, so this suited their state. Read for example Al-Mudaththir and Al-Qamar. The Madinan verses are gentler in approach and speech because most of the people were accepting of the message and submitting to it. Read Al-Mā’idah for example.<br>\n2. The Makkan verses are usually shorter, and are strong with their argument against the deniers (i.e. the idolators) and are appropriate to their condition at the time. Read At-Toor as an example. The Madinan verses are usually longer, and they mention the rulings and laws without debate because the condition of the people was appropriate for that. Read Al-Baqarah.</p><p><strong>Secondly: The subject matter of the Quranic verses:</strong></p><p>1. The Makkan verses predominantly explain and clarify Tawheed and the correct Islamic belief, specifically dealing with the Tawheed of worship and belief in the Resurrection because most of those being addressed denied these affairs. The Madinan verses, in general, discuss the details of worship, interaction and dealings because those addressed have Tawheed and Aqeedah established in their souls – so they are in need of detailed rules related to worship and dealings.<br>\n2. In Madinah, detailed elaboration is given to the rules concerning Jihad and dealing with the hypocrites and their condition in accordance with prevailing situations. That is because Jihad was required and hypocrisy had appeared in the Madinan era. This was not the case in Makkah. (See <em>Usool at-Tafseer</em> of Ibn Uthaimeen)</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Verse 5</p><p>This verse literally means: 'Thee alone do we worship, and Thee alone do we implore for help.' This is the fifth verse of the <em>Surah</em>. The author of the Commentary, giving a descriptive translation writes:</p><p>\"The (verse) <em>Iyyāka na’budu wa iyyāka nasta’īn </em>means: O Thou Lord of perfect attributes and source of the four graces, we worship Thee alone and in the due performance of duty of worship and in other calls and needs we seek only Thy help. Thou art our only God and in order to reach Thee we choose no other deity as our medium, neither man nor idol, nor do we rely on our wisdom or our knowledge; in everything we implore Thee, the Absolute Almighty, for help.\" </p><p>Verse 6</p><p><em><strong>Guide us to the straight path . . . nor of those gone astray:</strong></em><em> </em>The meaning of <em>“al-hidayah”</em> (<strong>الهداية</strong> = guidance, to guide) may easily be understood, if we consider first the significance of the “path”.<em>“as-Sirat” </em>(<strong>الصراط</strong> = path) is synonymous with <em>at-tarīq</em> (<strong>الطريق</strong>) and <em>as-sabīl </em>(<strong>السّبيل</strong>).</p><p>In these verses, Allah has commended the path that it is straight and that it is the path taken by those upon whom Allah has bestowed His bounties and favours. It is this path guidance to which has been asked for. And it is the ultimate goal of the worship: The servant prays to his Lord that his worship, clean from all im­purities, be performed in this path.</p><p>Allah has mentioned in His Book that He has laid down a path for man, nay, for all the creation, a path upon which they are proceeding. He says:</p><p>O <em><strong>man! Surely thou art striving to thy Lord, a hard striving, until thou art to meet Him </strong></em><strong>(84:6)</strong><em><strong>;</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>. . . and to Him is the ultimate resort </strong></em><strong>(64:3)</strong><em><strong>;</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>. . . now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come </strong></em><strong>(42:53).</strong></p><p>There are many such verses, showing that all are proceeding on a prescribed road and that their destination is Allah. So far as the way is concerned, Allah has said that there are two ways, not one:</p>",
