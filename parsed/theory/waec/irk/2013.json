        "answer": "<p>the attitude of the people to worship was influenced by respect for norms and traditions which informed their being pure idol-worshippers; their idol-worship represents the primitive form of semitic belief; they believed in plurality of gods in about 365 idols deposited at Ka;bah as objects of worship; the objects of worship were carved by themselves and were of many kinds conferred with powers of varying degrees; it was their belief that the idols served as intermediaries between them and the Supreme Being.</p>",

Then, the verses descended on him, like refreshing rain and gave him a new strength, which ceased his enemies taunts.</p><p>This Surah begins with two oaths and then informs the holy Prophet (S) of the good news that Allah has never forsaken him nor left him alone.</p><p>It adds that, soon, Allah will provide for him so abundantly that he will become content.</p><p>And in the last verses of the Surah, He reminds the Prophet (S) of his past life to illustrate how Allah has always bestowed His loving care on him and in the most difficult moments has supported him in the past and so his future was sure.</p><p>That is why, at the end of the Surah. He bids him, (in appreciation of the very great bounties) to be kind with the orphans and the needy, thus:</p><p><em><strong>“Therefore treat not the orphans with harshness,\"</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>\"And for the one who asks, repulse not,\"</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>\"And as for the bounties of your Lord, do announce (it)”.</strong></em></p>",

        "question": "<p>Examine the importance of the Quran to humankind.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>The importance of the Quran is best comprehended once we have established a good understanding of the purpose of this Holy Book. All the prophets that have been sent by God hold one reason as their objective and mission, that is, the guidance of mankind. With each prophet and apostle, the commands and instructions God has sent with the previous messenger would be completed, as were the books that were revealed to each prophet. Hence, the purpose of each Holy Book can be stated as such:</p><ol>\n<li>Verification and completion for the books that came before it</li>\n<li>Guidance for humanity</li>\n</ol><p>Since God has intended to guide mankind, it is logical that He should send a book along with the religion in order for the people to seek commandment and guidance from it. From this we can understand the importance of the Quran better. The Quran which is the last Holy Scripture revealed to the last Prophet is both guide and verification as stated in the Book itself. The guidance of mankind would be redundant had God not sent a book in which all His rules and instructions have been existed. Subsequently, when a person sets foot unto the path of monotheism and seeks guidance, they would need a manual whose authenticity and endurance are reliable for reference.</p>",

Some examples include Zubayda bint Ja’far al-Mansur who pioneered a most ambitious project of digging wells and building service stations all along the pilgrimage route from Baghdad to Mecca, Sutayta who was a mathematician and an expert witness in the courts, Dhayfa Khatun who excelled in management and statesmanship, Fatima al-Fihriyya who founded the Qarawiyin mosque in Fez, Morocco, which is said to be the first university in the world, and the engineer Al-‘Ijlia who made astrolabes in Aleppo.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\">Islam</a>, <em><strong>iddah</strong></em> or <em><strong>iddat</strong></em> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language\">Arabic</a>: العدة‎; <em>period of waiting</em>) is the period a woman must observe after the death of her husband or after a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_Islam\">divorce</a>, during which she may not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Islam\">marry</a> another man. One of its main purposes is to remove any doubt as to the paternity of a child born after the divorce or death of the prior husband.</p><p>The length of ‘iddah varies according to a number of circumstances. Generally, the ‘iddah of a woman divorced by her husband is three monthly periods, but if the marriage was not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consummation\">consummated</a> there is no ‘iddah. For a woman whose husband has died, the ‘iddah is four lunar months and ten days after the death of her husband, whether or not the marriage was consummated. If a woman is pregnant when she is widowed or divorced, the ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth.</p><p>Islamic scholars consider this directive to be a balance between mourning of husband's death and protecting the widow from criticism that she might be subjected to from remarrying too quickly after her husband’s death. This is also to ascertain whether a woman is pregnant or not, since four and a half months is half the length of a normal pregnancy.</p>",

        "answer": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h2> </h2>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) gave us a comprehensive paradigm for coexistence. The Muslims emigrants’ stay in Abyssinia provides one such good example. When some of the early Muslims were subjected to the coercion of the Quraysh to abandon their religion, they were forced to emigrate to Abyssinia. In so doing, they resorted to a method that has been used by many prophets of God who preceded Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). The Holy Quran mentions in many verses how many prophets before him migrated with their followers to escape the persecution and torture they suffered at the hands of the disbelievers. But we have to stop at this point and contemplate the events surrounding the Muslims’ first migration to Abyssinia and learn from the lessons it contains. When the conditions of the Muslims reached the point where they could no longer tolerate the persecution of the Quraysh, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered them to take their families and go to Abyssinia. However, he himself did not go with them but migrated to Medina after a number of years.<br>\n<br>\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not think of migrating from Mecca, except after he:</p>\n<p>1-Exhausted all the means of inviting the people of Quraysh to Islam.</p>\n<p>2-Made sure that his Companions were safe and that they have all migrated and safely settled in Medina. He did not migrate until Islam had entered each house in Medina and after the city had become a safe homeland for the Muslim community and Islam.</p>\n<p>Like Mecca, Abyssinia was not a Muslim society. But it king, Negus, preserved the rights of the Muslim minority, and gave them protection and freedom of faith. Abyssinia was a described as a land where no one was oppressed and this is what prompted the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to encourage Muslims to migrate there.</p>\n<p>Muslims lived in Abyssinia as a minority yet they enjoyed a secure and safe life and rights and freedom in a non-Islamic country.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

Goods passed through chains of Muslim traders, purchased, finally, by local non-Muslims at the southern most end of the route.</p><p>In the 5th century transporting heavy loads long distance was made much easier by the introduction of the camel to the trade routes. There were many trading partners in Sub-Saharan Africa. Gold was the main commodity sought by the North. Until the first half of the 13th century the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/index_section4.shtml\">kingdom of Ghana</a> was a key trading partner with the Muslim North.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Describe the conditions that must be satisfied before embarking on Hajj.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>the background that Hajj means stranger, Hajj is a Muslim pilgrimage to the holy land of Makkah and other places in Saudi Arabia during the month of Hajj. It is one of the five pillars of Islam that is compulsory once in a life time of a Muslim that is  able to meet its conditions. Hajj has a lot of benefits ranging from the spiritual to the mundane to those who perform it.However, before these benefits can be achieved, an intending pilgrim must have met the conditions of Hajj and also able to make certain provisions before embarking on the holy journey. The conditions of Hajj and its provisions are as follows. Conditions of Hajj (1) The intending pilgrim must be a Muslim with sound ‘Aqidah (doctrine, faith, believe) and must have been performing the four other pillars of Islam.<br>\n </p><p>Pillars of Islam It must be noted that faith is a of the validity of the deeds and its approval in Islam. (2) Must have attained adulthood, although if a child performs Hajj, he will be rewarded for it, however this will not suffice him as regards the Hajj prescribed in Islam. (3) Must be of a sound state of mind and in full control of his mental faculties. (4) Must possess ability: this includes the following, must be healthy and physically fit, to undergo the rigours of the journey and rites; must be sure that the way to the holy land is safe and secure from any danger; must be financially sound enough to be able to bear all of the expenses for Hajj, also to provide adequately for his dependants before leaving home. Provisions of Hajj: (i) The intention must be purified by performing the Hajj simply because of Allah. (ii) All Hajj expenses must be paid out of money obtain through hallal (legitimate) means. (iii) Must learn how to be patient and forgive others, (iv) Performing Nafila Istikhara (Salat for seeking divine guidance), and not to visit a maraubout. (v) Seeking knowledge of Hajj and Umrah through attending Hajj lectures, reading of books on Hajj, getting familiar with all aspects of the Hajj, such as, recitation of talbiyya, duah (prayer), place of rituals, etc. Also important is learning the adabs (etiquette) of traveling, entering transportation and landing in a place etc. (vi) Paying allyour outstanding debts, returns all items in your care to their owners. (vii) Fulfill your promises to another; (viii) correct all wrongs and mistakes done to anyone.  Others include writing of wil a written acknowledgment of the transaction, promises, and debts, between you and others and keep them in a safe place accessible to the member of your family; (x) getting the required travel needs such as documents, inoculation, basic travel allowance, etc. Basic travel allowance (xi) Hand over your family to someone who can assist them while you are away. (xii) Inform the necessary people of your intention. (xiii) Make a lot of dua’according to the dictates of the Shariah. (xii) A female pilgrim must travel in the company of her husband or a Mahram (i.e., a member of her immediate family with whom her marriage is expressly prohibited by the Shariah e.g., father, brother, son, uncle, etc). (xiii) Above all, an intending pilgrim must be conscious and fear Allah in his actions, speech and dealings. These are very important steps because Qur’an 2 verse 197 says: “the best provision is taqwah llah (fear of Allah)”. All this, and many others are based on specific instructions from the Shariah and must be followed for the Hajj to be meaningful.<br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>Outline the Islamic views on Death, Resurrection and Judgement .</p>",
        "answer": "<p>Islam teaches that there is life after death, and this is known as Akhirah. In Islam, it is Allah who decides when a person dies and most Muslims believe that when they die, they will stay in their graves until Yawm al-din, the Day of Judgement. On that day, they will be raised from their graves and brought before Allah and judged on how they lived their earthly lives. This belief is known as the resurrection of the body.</p><p>Those who have performed more good deeds than bad will enter <strong>Jannah</strong>, or Paradise. Jannah is a place described as a 'garden of everlasting bliss' and a 'home of peace'. In Jannah there will be no sickness, pain or sadness.</p><p>Those who have performed more bad deeds than good will enter <strong>Jahannam</strong> or Hell. This is a place of physical and spiritual suffering.</p><p>Muslims believe that Allah is forgiving, merciful and compassionate, so not all bad actions will be punished. Allah will forgive those who have repented for their sins and those who have done some good in their lives, for example showing kindness to others.</p><p>There are, however, some sins that many Muslims believe to be unforgivable. These include the sin of shirk.</p><h2>Why do Muslims believe in life after death?</h2><p>The main <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zkjxvcw/revision\">source of authority</a> for Muslims is the Qur'an.</p><p>Muslims believe that Allah is in charge of their lives and decides how long they will live. The Qur'an says:</p><blockquote><q>Nor can a soul die except by Allah’s leave. The term being fixed as by writing.</q><cite>Qur'an 3:145</cite></blockquote><p>People's deeds will be taken into account on the Day of Judgement. The Qur'an states that the good will receive reward, while the bad will receive punishment:</p><blockquote><q>Of the good that they do nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that do right. Those who reject faith – neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: they will be companions of the fire, dwelling therein forever.</q><cite>Qur'an 3:115-3:116</cite></blockquote><p>Belief in life after death is central to the meaning and purpose of most Muslims' lives. Many Muslims believe that they are on this earth for a relatively short time and during this time they are preparing themselves for eternal life after death. They view this life as a test and try to do as many good deeds as they can. In order to get to Jannah, they must also fulfil their Islamic obligations.</p>",
