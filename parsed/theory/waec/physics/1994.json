        "answer": "<p>(a) The specific heat capacity of copper is 400 \\(JKg^{-1}K^{-1}\\) means that 400 J of heat energy is required to raise (or lower) the temperature of 1 kg of a piece of copper by 1 kelvin.</p><p>(b) Experiment to determine the specific heat capacity of copper using a copper ball. The piece of copper ball is suspended by a thread and placed in a beaker of boiling water. While the temperature of the copper is being raised to boiling point of water, a copper calorimeter is half filled with water. The initial temperature of the water is measured and recorded and the hot copper ball is lifted by the thread and transferred to the calorimeter when the water has reached boiling point. The calorimeter cover is put on, the mixture is well stirred and the final steady temperature read from the themometer. The copper ball is weighed either before or after the experiment. The result is tabulated as shown below.</p><p>Mass of copper ball - m (kg)</p><p>Temperature of boiling water - \\(\\theta\\) (K)</p><p>Mass of copper calorimeter - \\(m_{c}\\) (kg)</p><p>Mass of calorimeter + water - \\(m_{x}\\) (kg)</p><p>Mass of water \\((m_{x} - m_{c})\\) - \\(m_{w}\\) (kg)</p><p>Specific heat capacity - C  \\((Jkg^{-1} K^{-1})\\)</p><p>Initial temperature of water = \\(\\theta_{w}\\) (K)</p><p>Final temperature of water = \\(\\theta_{f}\\) (K)</p><p>Using Heat lost by copper ball = Heat gained by calorimeter + Heat gained by water</p><p>\\(mc(\\theta - \\theta_{f}) = m_{c} c (\\theta_{f} - \\theta_{w}) + m_{w} c_{w} (\\theta_{f} - \\theta_{w})\\)</p><p>\\(c = \\frac{m_{w} c_{w} (\\theta_{f} - \\theta_{w})}{m (\\theta - \\theta_{f}) - m_{c} (\\theta_{f} - \\theta_{w})}\\)</p><p> Precautions: (i) The copper ball should be transferred quickly into the calorimeter without splashing. (ii) Just before transfer, the copper should be shaken slightly to remove adhering hot water.</p><p>(iii) Heat lost by copper ball = heat gained by copper calorimeter + Hoat gained by water.</p><p>\\(m_{c} (\\theta - \\theta_{f}) = m c (\\theta_{f} - \\theta_{w}) + m_{w} c_{w} (\\theta_{f} - \\theta_{w})\\)</p><p>\\(20 \\times 0.4 \\times (200 - \\theta_{f}) = 60 \\times 0.4 \\times (\\theta_{f} - 30) + 50 \\times 4.2 \\times (\\theta_{f} - 30)\\)</p><p>\\(8(200 - \\theta_{f}) = 24(\\theta_{f} - 30) + 210 (\\theta_{f} - 30)\\)</p><p>\\(\\theta_{f} = \\frac{8620}{242} = 35.6K\\)</p>",

The wooden box effective length, I of the string remains constant throughout the experiment. Also the string used is of uniform thickness and must not be changed to ensure that the mass per unit length is constant throughout the experiment. The length of string is tied to the stake at one free end while a known mass is added to the other end. This creates a tension in the string which is equal to the weight of the attached mass. A tuning fork of known frequency is set vibrating and the string is tuned in unison with the fork. The frequency of the fork is recorded. The procedure is repeated by increasing the masses and using different tuning forks four more times. The corresponding tension (weights) and frequency are recorded in a table. Experiment to show that frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension, T. Mathematically, the graph of F against \\(\\sqrt{T}\\) is a straight line through the origin.</p><p>(b)(i) <img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan%20%283%29%2813%29.jpg\" style=\"height:87px; width:250px\"></p><p>(ii) Second overtone</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan%20%284%29%283%29.jpg\" style=\"height:70px; width:300px\"></p><p>(c)(i) <img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan0402%20%282%29_LI.jpg\" style=\"height:88px; width:250px\"></p><p>(ii) <img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan0402%20%283%29.jpg\" style=\"height:131px; width:250px\"></p>",

In this case mechanical energy i.e kinetic energy, due to the motion of the bar magnet is changed to electrical energy in the form of induced current. </p><p>(c) <img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/scan0402%20%287%29.jpg\" style=\"height:130px; width:250px\"></p><p>A simple d.c. electric motor can supply direct current (d.c.) by using a split - ring commutator.The brush (-) touches one half of the split ring X while the other brush (+) touches the other half Y. As the coil rotates it cuts through the magnetic flux linking the magnets and current is induced which flows through the coil as shown in the diagram. As the coil rotates past the vertical Y moves round to touch (-) while X moves round to touch (+). This action reverses the connections to the external resistance connected to (-) and (+). The reverse happens when the current is just zero (coil vertical) so instead of the current reversing in the external resistance, it continues to flow in the same direction.</p><p> c(ii)  (1) Part of the current is wasted in form of heat due to the resistance of the coil and this reduces efficiency;</p><p>(2) Friction between the moveable parts of the motor makes the efficiency to reduce. </p>",
