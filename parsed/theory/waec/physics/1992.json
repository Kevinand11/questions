It works by electromagnetic induction, the magnetic flux from the primary coil in the iron core links the secondary coil.

This produces corresponding variation of magnetic flux in the iron core which links the secondary coil. An induced e.m.f \\(E_{s}\\) of the same frequency as \\(E_{p}\\) is obtained.

In general the emission of electrons from matter as a result of electromagnetic wave falling on the matter is referred to as photoelectric effect.Emission of electrons depends only on the threshold frequency.
