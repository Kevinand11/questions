        "answer": "<p>The process of egg formation in poultry is controlled by hormones. The egg is formed partly in the ovary and partly the oviduct. Yolk is formed In the ovary while other proteinous parts are formed in the liver and kidney. The yolk released by the ovary is taken up by infidibuIum and later moved to the oviduct where fertilization takes place The egg moves to the magnum, stay there for three hours and part of the albumen is formed. Chalaza is secreted round the yolk from the magnum. the egg moves to the isthmus where it stays for 1¼ hours and the two shell membrane, are formed. The shape of the egg is also formed in this region. The egg then, moves to the uterus where it slays for 19-20 hours, The Shell is formed in the uterus. The egg is then passed to the vagina where it stays for a very short time before it is laid</p>",

The food gets to the rumen through the oesophagus by peristalsis. Micro-organisms in the rumen act on the grass. The cattle rests quietly an regurgitates the food back to the mouth through the reticulum by anti-peristaltic movement where the food is properly re-chewed in the mouth. After chewing,t cud is re-swallowed and the food goes to the omasum and later to the abomasum where enzymes are secret on the food. The digested food is absorbed into t body through the villi while the undigested ones a passed into the large intestine from where they are r moved as feaces or dung through the anus. </p>",
