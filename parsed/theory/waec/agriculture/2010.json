        "answer": "<p>(a) Distinction between agricultural systems: (i) monoculture is the practice of cultivating one and the same crop on the same piece of land every cropping season. Whereas, Monocropping is a practice of cultivating a single crop species each growing season and harvesting it before another crop is planted.</p><p> (ii) shifting cultivation is a farming system whereby a piece of land is cultivated continuously for some years and then abandoned as a result of the decline in soil fertility, build-up of pests and diseases, and the resultant reduction in crop yield. The farmer abandons not only the exhausted farmland but also his settlement for a new farm and a new settlement with no hope of coming back. Whereas Land rotation involves growing crops on a piece of land until it is exhausted and the land is left to fallow for some years before it is used again. The farmer clears other areas in succession to make new farms while remaining in his farmstead.</p><p>( b) Problems of commercial agriculture in West Africa. <br>\n-Inadequate supply of improved varieties of crops and livestock <br>\n-Unfavourable land tenure system/land fragmentation does not allow commercial agriculture to be practised <br>\n-High capital investment on machinery and other inputs/expensive machinery and other inputs <br>\n-Inadequate marketing channels Inadequate technical know-how on the operation and ,maintenance of farm machinery <br>\n-High Cost of spare parts <br>\n-Inadequate processing facilities <br>\n-In adequate skilled manpower <br>\n-Inaadequate credit facilities / subsidies <br>\n- Inadequate storage and processing facilities <br>\n-Inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides used for commercial farming could pose health hazards to man and the environment if not properly applied <br>\n- It leads to the displacement of small scale farmers from their lands <br>\n- Unfavourable government policies <br>\n- It can lead to soil erosion. </p><p>(c) Uses of the farm tractor: <br>\n-Transportation of farm inputs, materials and farm produce / haulage with trailer attached. <br>\n- It operates water pumps for irrigation or other farm purposes <br>\n- Lifting of coupled implements through the hydraulic system <br>\n- Pulling of farm implements like ploughs, etc <br>\n- Titling the soil with appropriate implement attached <br>\n- Planting seeds when coupled with planters <br>\n- Spraying seedlings when coupled with sprayers <br>\n-Harvesting crops when coupled together with appropriate machines <br>\n-It can be a stationary power source for equipment like shellers, grinders, etc. <br>\n- Provision of electric power <br>\n- Can be used to operate milking machines<br>\n - Can be used for mowing lawn with mowers. </p><p>(d) Indigenous methods of sand preparation: <br>\n- Slashing / cutting <br>\n- Hoeing <br>\n- Felling <br>\n- Stumping <br>\n- Burning <br>\n- Mounding <br>\n-Ridging</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) The law of diminishing returns The law states that as successive amounts of a variable factor are applied to one or more fixed factors, output might increase a lot at first but there comes a point at which the use of an additional amount of the variable factor will add less to output than the preceding amount.</p><p> (ii) Explanation of the main cause of diminishing returns in agricultural production. Wrong combination of inputs: <br>\nIf the amount of variable factor used is in excess of the fixed factor of production, diminishing returns will set in. For instance, if a plot of land (fixed) is to be cultivated by ten men (variable) under normal situation, but suddenly, the number is increased to twenty-five (25), there would be room for laziness, gossiping and general under-utilization of labour. </p><p>(b) Calculation of salvage value, total depreciation and annual depreciation of the combine harvester <br>\nSalvage value <br>\n+ #30,000.00 <br>\n<strong>Total Depreciation </strong><br>\nCost price - Salvage value <br>\n= #100,000.00 = #30,000.00 <br>\n=  #70,000.00 <br>\n<strong>Annual depreciation </strong><br>\n= Cost price - Salvage value  <br>\n      Useful life in years <br>\n= #100,000.00 - #30,000.00<br>\n            10 years <br>\n= #70,000.00<br>\n   10 years <br>\n = #7,000.00</p><p>(c) Problems of Agricultural Extension services In West Africa <br>\n- Inadequate extension officers <br>\n- Inadequate transportation/poor accessibility to farming communities <br>\n- Inadequate incentives for extension officers/insufficient motivation of extension agents <br>\n- Illiteracy of the farmers <br>\n-Poor monitoring of extension service agents <br>\n-Conservatism of the farmers <br>\n-Undefined roles for extension agents <br>\n-Inadequate credit facilities to the farmer <br>\n-Corruption among extension personnel <br>\n-Inadequate supply of subject matter specialists <br>\n-Inadequate coordination between extension service and the agricultural research institution <br>\n-Inadequate farm-inputs to back-up extension messages <br>\n-Conflicting religious beliefs and tradition <br>\n-Inadequate extension service amenities <br>\n-Inadequate programme evaluation <br>\n-Non-involvement of farmers in planning extension programme <br>\n-Language barrier<br>\n </p>",
