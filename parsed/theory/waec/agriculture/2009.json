(v) Cover cropping/Afforestation/High density planting. (vi) Strip cropping (vii) Mulching </p><p>(b) How each practice can be used to conserve the soil: <br>\n(i) Terracing:<br>\n-A practice in which the slope is broken into series of steps/platforms. <br>\n-Each platform/step is constructed along a contour so that each of them is on uniform height, but different from those above or below it. <br>\nIt is done to reduce the length and gradient of slope and hence reduce the speed of run-off. <br>\n-Water collected on each gentle slope runs across the field rather than down. <br>\n-Each terrace has a drainage channel which empties into a grassed waterway which leads the water down the slope to nearby channel. </p><p>(ii) Contour ploughing <br>\n-The slope is first surveyed to locate contour points. <br>\n-Ploughing is now done along the contours joining all areas along each contour. <br>\n-These contours are running across the slope of the land. <br>\n- Plants are established along the contours and not across. <br>\n-An effective way of preventing soil loss and hence promoting soil conservation. </p><p>(iii)Ridging across the slope <br>\n-Flood water will normally run down along the slope of a land. <br>\n- Ridges constructed should be across the slope to block the run-off water. <br>\n- Such ridges will also help to trap the water into small reservoirs which will sink into the soil. <br>\n- Can be practised by every farmer without much -technical know-how. </p><p>(iv)Construction of drainages <br>\n-Drainages are means of getting rid of excess water in the field.<br>\n- Many types of drainages are available, they may be )pen channels or underground channels. <br>\n-pipes are laid along the slope to carry the water straight down into reservoirs below, thus preventing soil erosion</p><p>(v) Cover cropping/Afforestation/High density Panting <br>\n-The principle is not to allow the surface to be exposed to agents of erosion e.g. wind, water. <br>\n-The slope is planted with cover crops or other crops to trap/retard any run-off water.<br>\n-They also promote the percolation of such water which as been retarded in its flow. <br>\n-Planting of forest tree/other crop species to also trap  and intercept water/dust from wind and thus protect the soil surface especially in the arid areas. <br>\n-Their leaves decay and enhance soil fertility, thereby encouraging more growth of other species. </p><p>(vi) Strip cropping <br>\n-planting of crops in rows along the contour interspersed by rows of uncultivated area/fallow, to retard water run-off across the slope. -planting of different crops with different growth characteristics in alternate rows along the contour and across the slope to check run-off . </p><p>(vii) Mulching <br>\n-Mulching is the act of covering soil surface with such\n-Materials as d grasses, crop residues and polyethylene sheets.<br>\n-Reduces the the impact.of rain drops on soil. <br>\n-reduces the speed of run-off. <br>\n-Decayed, mulch improves soil structure and so help  check soil erosion.  </p>",
