        "answer": "<p>1 (a) Data handling is the process/way of ensuring that data is obtained, stored archived or disposed in a manner that retains its integrity  in a second manner. OR Data handling is basically the process/way of inputting and storing data in a computer. The Data is then processed into information.</p><p><strong>(b) There sre two ways of handling data which are;</strong></p><p>(i) Electronic method; This is the use of electronic system such as computers, storage media like video tape, CD,DVD, Memory cards and other electronic devices to obtain, store, archive, share or dispose data.</p><p>(ii) Non-electronic/Manual method: This involves the use of paper files, journals, laboratory notebooks, human effects and other non-electronic means to store or share data.</p><p><strong>(c) Factors to be considered when handling data electronically;</strong> Data intergrity, Regular update of data, Validation of data, Security of data/Encryption, Type of Data, Type of storage to be used, Data volume/size, Access control, Regular Anti-virus update, Limit physical  access to storage media, Regular Backups/Ensure data recoverbility, Record Date and Time, Power supply.</p>",
