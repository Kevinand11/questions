Its height ranges from 950ft to over 3000ft. Lowest in the North East and highest in the North West. The North West is made up of rugged relief and steep slopes. Pockets of isolated hills cut across from North West to South East. Other parts have gentle rolling slopes (SW and NE parts). V shaped valleys in the N W. The presence of cliffs are also found in the NW part.</p><p><strong>(c) Influence of relief on settlement </strong><br>\nThe area mapped shows dispersed settlement pattern due to high relief of the a7-ea. Most settlements are also the more gentle slopes South of the map. The more rugged (mountainous) areas North West of the map attract less settlements. The only settlements in the North West are Mayo, Dongi and Kenchungu. Settlements avoid the steep slopes and passes attract settlement location such as Karlahi.</p>",

Such uplifts are often of a considerable size. It is a fairly uniform altitude. Plateaux can be tilted as a result of imbalance by compressional forces e.g the Messefa of central Iberia. Some other plateaux are surrounded by fold mountains and they are referred to as intermonte plateau. Example is Jos Plateau.</p><p><strong>(ii) Mode of formation of Dissected Plateaux</strong><br>\nThey originate from either tectonic.or volcanic plateaux. Dissected plateaux result from continual process of weathering and erosion caused by running water, ice and wind.

Tropical grasslands are found in West Africa, East and Central Africa, North of Capricorn and South America while Temperate grasslands are found in the heart of Asia, North America, South Africa, Argentina and in the Darling Plains of Australia. In West Africa, Tropical grasslands are known as savanna. In South America they are known as Llanos, Campos in Brazil whereas the temperate grasslands are known as Steppe in Asia, Prairie in North America, Veld South Africa, Pampas in Argentina and Down in Australia. Tropical grassland is consists mainly of grasses and the height vary from about 2 - 3 metres while temperate grassland is composed of very short grasses. Grasses in the tropical grassland are more compact while that of the temperate grasslands are generally sparse and often in discontinuous clumps. The trees of the Tropical grassland are many while in temperate grassland they are few and in some area non-existence. Trees in tropical grassland are about 10-20m or more, they are tall and scattered while in temperate grassland, they are shorter. The trees of the tropical grassland have long tap roots while trees in temperate grassland have shorter roots.The grasses of the temperate grassland are more nutritious to animals than those of the tropical grassland. in tropical grassland, the popular trees are acacia,baobab, shea butter while in the temperate grasslands trees are poplar, willows and alders.</p><p><strong>(b)(i) Description of the climate associated with:</strong><br>\n<strong>The Tropical Grassland</strong></p><ul>\n<li>It has two distinct seasons of wet and dry.</li>\n<li>Dry seasons are long while the wet seasons are short.</li>\n<li>Temperature is uniformly high ranging between 27°C and 32°C (80°F and 90°F).</li>\n<li>Annual temperature range is about 11°C.</li>\n<li>Rainfall is mainly convectional and it falls in wet season.</li>\n<li>Relative humidity is high during the rainy season (60%) with single maximum rainfall.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>The dry season is characterized by </strong></p><ul>\n<li>low relative humidity (20%).</li>\n<li>Clouds are thick and low during the rainy season.</li>\n<li>Insolation is considerably reduced during the rainy season by clouds.</li>\n<li>It is high during the dry season.</li>\n<li>There is abundant sunshine throughout the year.</li>\n<li>Winds are rain-bearing in wet season, but hot, dry and dusty in the dry season.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>(ii) The Temperate Grassland </strong></p><ul>\n<li>The temperate grassland has four seasons namely, summer, autumn, winter and spring.</li>\n<li>The climate is continental.</li>\n<li>Temperature is high in summer, usually more than 25°C (77°F) and cold in winter to the freezing point.</li>\n<li>It has a high range of temperature.</li>\n<li>Rainfall is usually very high and it is between 400mm and 600mm.</li>\n<li>Rainfall is convectional.</li>\n<li>Humidity is very high during the summer, clouds are generally light for most of the year.</li>\n<li>They become heavy before the rains.</li>\n<li>The areas are influenced by South Westerlies. <br>\n </li>\n</ul>",
