Prismatic compass is a prism with a slit in it and has a slight vane with a vertical line opposite the prism. Most often, it contains a circular card and graduated in degrees (0° — 360°). The plane containing the prism slit and the sight vane hair also contain the pivot of the compass card. The prism reflects the figure of the card immediately below it and allow the surveyor to read. A prismatic compass contains a magnetic needle, pointing to the magnetic north.</p><p><strong>(b) The precaution to be taken when making a compass traverse are as follows: </strong></p><p>(i) All magnetic materials should be removed from the body and pockets of the reader before the bearing is taken. </p><p>(ii) The bearing should not be observed from a position close to strongly, magnetic materials eg. corrugated iron sheets, railway lines or power lines.</p><p>(iii) The compass must be held horizontally so that the edge of the card does not rub against the top of the compass.</p><p>(iv) The \"back\" bearing should be taken from the other end of the line and should differ from the on/forward bearing by exactly 180°. <br>\n </p>",

In well jointed rocks, water may percolate downwards until it reaches a joint which emerges at the surface. The water may come to the surface through the joint to form a spring. Where a dyke or sill of impermeable rock is intruded through permeable rocks it causes the water table to reach the surface. The water issues out as spring. In limestone or chalk escarpments, where the permeable rock lies between impermeable strata, water issues at the foot of the scarp as springs. In Karst regions rivers often disappear underground and may re-emerge as a resurgence.<br>\n </p>",
