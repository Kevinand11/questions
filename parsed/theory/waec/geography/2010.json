It is common at the coastal areas where highlands lie at right angles I the coast. When moisture laden wind comes into contact with the highland, it is forced to rise. The rising air expands, cools and condenses. Clouds are formed and rain falls at the windward side. Cool dry winds descend at the leeward side and produce little or no rainfall.

The result of this is that the Mediterranean Sea has flooded over 400,000 hectares of fertile farmlands.<br>\n(iv) Fluctuation in the volume of water and salination.<br>\n(v) Social problems of displaced people (resettlement) and collapsed dam.<br>\n(vi) Retained water in the dams creates diseases e.g. Bilharzia, river blindness.<br>\n(vii) Growth of water weeds.<br>\n(viii) Decrease in amount of fresh water has led to decline of fishing industry in Egypt.<br>\n </p>",
