        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE TEMPERATURE OF A PLACE. </strong></p><p><strong>(i) LATITUDE:- </strong>Tropical latitudes generally are hotter than temperate latitudes because the sun's altitude is generally high in the tropics and lower in the temperate. Similarly, temperate latitude are warmer than polar latitudes.</p><p><strong>(ii) ALTITUDE:-</strong> Places nearer the earth's surface are warmer than those at higher altitude. Temperature decreases with increasing height above sea-level. The late of decrease in temperature is 0.6°C with an ascent of 100m above sea-level. Example: Mount Kilimanjaro (about 6000m) although close to the Equator is always snow capped, Jos Plateau and the Guinea Highland in West Africa are good examples.</p><p><strong>(iii) DISTANCE FROM THE SEA:- </strong>Land surfaces heat and cool faster than sea surfaces. The sea warms coastal regions in winter but cools them in summer. In summer, land surfaces are warmer than sea surfaces and the air over the land, therefore, is warmer than the one over the sea which make coastal regions to be cooler than inland.</p><p><strong>(iv) PREVAILING WINDS:- </strong>Winds affect temperature by transporting their heat or coldness into adjacent regions. On-shore Westerlies convey much tropical warm air to temperate coasts especially in winter. In Britain and Norway Westerlies tend to be cool winds in summer and warm variable in moderating the climate. Local winds such as Fohn, Chinook, Sirocco, Mistral also produce marked changes in temperature. The North-East trade wind from the Sahara lowers the night and morning temperatures of the Sahel region.</p><p><strong>(v) OCEAN CURRENTS:- </strong>Warm ocean currents tend to have increased temperature. Cold currents tend to have a reducti3n in temperature. Ocean currents such as the Gulf steams or the North Atlantic Drift warm the coastal district', Western Europe and by so doing keep their coasts ice - free.</p><p><strong>(vi) CLOUD OVER:-</strong> This acts as blanket, reducing the amount of radiation reaching the earth. Leads to lowering of temperature.</p><p><strong>(b)(i) TWO CLIMATIC ELEMENTS USED AS BASIS OF KOPPEN'S CLASSIFICATION. </strong><br>\n(i) Tempc.rature.<br>\n(ii) Precipitation / rainfall.</p><p><strong>(ii) KOPPENS CLIMATIC GROUPS</strong><br>\nA = Tropical rain climates<br>\nB = Dry climates.<br>\nC = Warm temperature rainy or humid meso-thermal climate.<br>\nD = Cool temperate or micro thermal climate.<br>\nE = Polar or ice climate<br>\n </p>",
