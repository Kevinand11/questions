        "answer": "<p> </p><p><strong>(a)• EMPLOYMENT GENERATION:</strong> Industrialization encourages mass production of goods. This require more labour to achieve.</p><p>And so would lead to employment of capable hands in the production process.</p><p>Also, as the country industrialize, more people would be employed to keep up with the production rate.</p><p><strong>• IMPROVED LIVING STANDARD/POVERTY REDUCTION:</strong> As employment is generated, the number of unemployed reduces. This goes to reduce poverty in the country. Also, increased industrial output means that the masses now have variety of goods to choose from at affordable prices. This equally goes to improve the living standards of the populace.</p><p> </p><p>(b)1. Power Crisis</p><p>Power failure has been a problem in Nigeria since day one. It is quite unfortunate that after the privatization of the power company, we still haven’t witnessed any outstanding improvement in power supply.</p><p>Electricity is a very important and indispensable tool to industrialization. Most manufacturing processes are automated, computers and machines are not powered by water but by electricity, and in a situation where this driving force is dysfunctional, there is bound to be an impediment to most if not all industrial activities.</p><h3>2. Misappropriation of Funds by Government</h3><p>Some time ago, the federal government approved N3.9billion for power transmission infrastructure, weeks after the approval of N1.3billion for manpower development and training of 3,700 people under National Power Sector Apprenticeship Scheme (NAPSAS). And then I questioned myself, why is government still spending so much money on power projects after privatizing the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)?</p><p>From my own understanding and dictionary meaning of the word “Privatization”, it entails the removal of something (PHCN) from governments control and placing it in private control or ownership; but why are they still getting involved? These are funds which could have been used to remedy other situations such as bad roads in order to favour industrialization.</p><h3>3. Excessive Dependence of Nigerians on Imported Goods</h3><p>Nigerians are being overly dependent on imported and “made in abroad” goods, regardless of the quality and safety. This particular observation has led to the exploitation of consumers by Nigerian based manufacturers and suppliers.</p><p>Some manufacturers now affiliate with Chinese companies to produce substandard products which is then shipped down to Nigeria.</p><p>The ones fortunate enough to produce theirs within Nigeria now resort to the replacement of the right country of production with a foreign country. You now get to see shoes coupled by a shoemaker at your backyard wearing tags such as “made in Italy”, “made in China” and you wonder, why the lies? It’s quite obvious because that’s what Nigerians like and want, they prefer “made in Italy/china” to “made in Nigeria” and shoemakers must sell their products right? So they just exploit Nigerian’s taste to sell theirs.</p><h3>4. Lack of Finance</h3><p>Setting up a company or industry is nothing compared to renting a shop and stocking it with imported products. Though both require capital and a good financial strength but it is more pronounced in industrial setup. Lack of finance by skilled and potential entrepreneurs therefore constitutes one of the major problem to industrialization.</p><p> </p><p><strong> (c)* Energy efficiency and conservation</strong></p><p><small>In order to prevent an energy crisis, it is also crucial that we consume less energy by improving and modernising <strong>energy infrastructure</strong> such as <strong>smart grid solutions</strong>, and <strong><a href=\"https://solarimpulse.com/smart-cities-solutions\">smart cities</a></strong>. It is also important that we replace old devices by energy efficient solutions, such as replacing traditional light bulbs by LEDs.</small></p><p>lack of finace </p><p>*Creating a monthly plan for your spending is one of the smartest things you can do for your finances, yet it’s the most overlooked solution to most people’s financial problems. Having a spending plan or a budget (the technical name for a monthly spending plan) makes life so much easier because you’ve given yourself a guide to decide how you want to spend your money.</p><p>Ironically, it’s also one of the things that you’ll likely never learn in a class at Cambridge or Harvard. Not to pick on these universities though; most schools don’t teach students how to create a budget. So to help with this lack of training, your third assignment is to outline your budget.</p><p>If you’ve never created a household budget that works, here is a <a href=\"https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/_Library/docs/CC_MMB_WEB2.pdf\">personal budget workbook</a> to get you started or you can try out <a href=\"https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/budgeting/budgeting-calculators-tools/budgeting-spreadsheet\">this interactive budgeting resource that guides you through the whole process</a>. A budget based on real numbers sets you up for success, so use what you learned when you tracked your spending.</p><p>If there’s an expense you want to cut out of your budget, start by reducing it by half. This will tell you if you can stick it out for the long term. If you can make having a budget part of your life, you’ll know that you’ve passed this assignment successfully!</p><p>*Digitizing the entire workflow means setting up a network-based environment or revenue management system where all the workflows regarding generating orders, making payments, generating receipts, recording data, and much more are all linked in one central system. When this is done, it ensures that every operation in the organisation is centralised, can be monitored remotely, and that the accounts can easily be reconciled since data is automatically recorded once an activity is done.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)*<strong>Heat and Metamorphism</strong></p><p><strong>    *Pressure and Metamorphism</strong></p><p><strong>    *Chemical Action of Fluids</strong></p><p>(c)There are three main types of rocks: sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic. Each of these rocks are formed by physical changes—such as melting, cooling, eroding, compacting, or deforming—that are part of the rock cycle.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sedimentary Rocks</strong><br>\n<br>\nSedimentary rocks are formed from pieces of other existing rock or organic material. There are three different types of sedimentary rocks: clastic, organic (biological), and chemical. Clastic sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, form from clasts, or pieces of other rock. Organic sedimentary rocks, like coal, form from hard, biological materials like plants, shells, and bones that are compressed into rock.<br>\n<br>\nThe formation of clastic and organic rocks begins with the weathering, or breaking down, of the exposed rock into small fragments. Through the process of erosion, these fragments are removed from their source and transported by wind, water, ice, or biological activity to a new location. Once the sediment settles somewhere, and enough of it collects, the lowest layers become compacted so tightly that they form solid rock.<br>\n<br>\nChemical sedimentary rocks, like limestone, halite, and flint, form from chemical precipitation. A chemical precipitate is a chemical compound—for instance, calcium carbonate, salt, and silica—that forms when the solution it is dissolved in, usually water, evaporates and leaves the compound behind. This occurs as water travels through Earth’s crust, weathering the rock and dissolving some of its minerals, transporting it elsewhere. These dissolved minerals are precipitated when the water evaporates.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Metamorphic Rocks</strong><br>\n<br>\nMetamorphic rocks are rocks that have been changed from their original form by immense heat or pressure. Metamorphic rocks have two classes: foliated and nonfoliated. When a rock with flat or elongated minerals is put under immense pressure, the minerals line up in layers, creating foliation. Foliation is the aligning of elongated or platy minerals, like hornblende or mica, perpendicular to the direction of pressure that is applied. An example of this transformation can be seen with granite, an igneous rock. Granite contains long and platy minerals that are not initially aligned, but when enough pressure is added, those minerals shift to all point in the same direction while getting squeezed into flat sheets. When granite undergoes this process, like at a tectonic plate boundary, it turns into gneiss (pronounced “nice”).<br>\n<br>\nNonfoliated rocks are formed the same way, but they do not contain the minerals that tend to line up under pressure and thus do not have the layered appearance of foliated rocks. Sedimentary rocks like bituminous coal, limestone, and sandstone, given enough heat and pressure, can turn into nonfoliated metamorphic rocks like anthracite coal, marble, and quartzite. Nonfoliated rocks can also form by metamorphism, which happens when magma comes in contact with the surrounding rock.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Igneous Rocks</strong><br>\n<br>\nIgneous rocks (derived from the Latin word for fire) are formed when molten hot material cools and solidifies. Igneous rocks can also be made a couple of different ways. When they are formed inside of the earth, they are called intrusive, or plutonic, igneous rocks. If they are formed outside or on top of Earth’s crust, they are called extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rocks.<br>\n<br>\nGranite and diorite are examples of common intrusive rocks. They have a coarse texture with large mineral grains, indicating that they spent thousands or millions of years cooling down inside the earth, a time course that allowed large mineral crystals to grow.<br>\n<br>\nAlternatively, rocks like basalt and obsidian have very small grains and a relatively fine texture. This happens because when magma erupts into lava, it cools more quickly than it would if it stayed inside the earth, giving crystals less time to form. Obsidian cools into volcanic glass so quickly when ejected that the grains are impossible to see with the naked eye.<br>\n<br>\nExtrusive igneous rocks can also have a vesicular, or “holey” texture. This happens when the ejected magma still has gases inside of it so when it cools, the gas bubbles are trapped and end up giving the rock a bubbly texture. An example of this would be pumice.</p><p>(c)</p><ul>\n<li>The<strong> rocks are the major source of the minerals</strong> such as <strong>the gold, diamond and the limestone and petroleum</strong> that can be exported to the south.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>Source of fuel</strong> and metasedimentary and local source of the fuel for the India and the domestic use.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li><strong>For the construction propose some rocks like the granite and sandstone for the road and the bridges.</strong></li>\n</ul>",

        "question": "<p>(a) List five sources of water pollution</p><p>(b) Highlight five measures that can be taken to control water pollution.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)</p><h2>Sewage (Waste Water)</h2><p>Sewage is another name for waste water from domestic and industrial processes. Despite strict regulatory control, the Environment Agency data shows that the water and sewage industry accounted for almost a quarter of the serious water incidents in England and Wales in 2006.</p><h2>Agricultural Pollution</h2><p>The agriculture industry covers 76% of the land area of England and Wales. Agricultural processes such as uncontrolled spreading of slurries and manure, disposal of sheep dip, tillage, ploughing of the land, use of pesticides and fertilisers can cause water pollution. Accidental spills from milk dairies can also affect the quality of water.</p><h2>Oil Pollution</h2><p>Every year there are about 3,000 pollution incidents involving oil and fuels in England and Wales. Oil spillages affect water quality in a number of ways. Oil can make drinking water unsafe to drink. A substantial amount of oil released into oceans and seas will destroy wildlife and the ecosystems that sustain them. Oil spills also reduce oxygen supplies within the water environment. The main causes of oil related water pollution are:</p><ul>\n<li>loss from storage facilities</li>\n<li>spillage during delivery and;</li>\n<li>deliberate disposal of waste oil to drainage systems</li>\n</ul><h2>Radioactive Substances</h2><p>Radioactive waste is another source of water pollution. Radioactive substances are used in nuclear power plants, industrial, medical and other scientific processes. They can be found in watches, luminous clocks, television sets and x-ray machinery. There are also naturally occurring radioisotopes from organisms and within the environment. If not properly disposed of, radioactive waste can result in serious water pollution incidents.</p><h2>River dumping</h2><p>Lots of people dump supermarket trolleys, bicycles, garden cuttings and electronic waste into rivers or river banks. This is illegal and offenders may be charged for fly-tipping if caught. River dumping not only causes water pollution; it also harms wildlife and increases the risk of flooding. Fly-tipping (this includes river dumping) is a criminal offence. In the most severe cases, it can attract a maximum fine of £50,000 or a 5 year jail term.</p><p>(b)</p><p><strong>1. Keep out oils, fat, or grease from the sink. </strong>Desist from pouring cooking oil, fat or grease down the kitchen sink. Instead, keep a jar that collects all the fats, grease or oil then discard in solid waste.</p><p><strong>2. Abstain from flushing contaminated liquids, pills, drugs, or medications down the drain. </strong>These substances contain scores of toxic materials that destroy the quality of natural water systems. Instead, use the recommended disposal methods.</p><p><strong>3. Desist from using the toilet as a bin. </strong>Most people discard dust clothes, paper wastes, synthetic materials, and wrappers in the toilet. The destructive elements of these materials may finally end up in the oceans, lakes or rivers. Desisting from this habit can considerably <a href=\"https://www.eartheclipse.com/pollution/awesome-solutions-to-water-pollution.html\" target=\"_blank\">prevent water pollution</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Ensure minimal use of bleach or detergents. </strong>During cleaning of laundry or cutleries, it is vital to minimize the use of bleach and detergents. Instead, you can persist on only using phosphate-free detergents and soaps.</p><p><strong>5. Reduce the use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. </strong>Excessive use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers leads to water pollution as the chemicals contained in the products often find way into the water systems through surface runoff or <a href=\"https://www.eartheclipse.com/pollution/devastating-effects-of-soil-pollution.html\" target=\"_blank\">infiltration into the soil</a>. Minimizing their usage or using organic methods for pest, weed, and disease control can appreciably reduce water pollution.</p>",

        "question": "<p>(a)In what five ways has railway transportation contributed to the economic development in Tropical Africa?</p><p>(b)Suggest five ways of improving the development of railway transportation in Tropical Africa.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)</p><p>Poor and substandard transport systems raise the transaction costs of doing business in African countries, which impedes the growth of economic activities. Despite the wealth and abundance of resources with which Africa is endowed, the serious deficits in Africa’s transport infrastructure place enormous strains on domestic economic productivity and limit the development of economic regional integration.</p><p>African states with inadequate transport systems suffer the consequences of the high transaction costs of doing business, as well as the huge inefficiencies created by poor transport systems that severely curtail economic development. As a result, intra-Africa trade still remains a challenge on the continent due to sub-standard transport networks. Given that intra-Africa trade is only 12% of all trade on the continent, Africa needs to improve transport infrastructure in order to increase the volume of trade amongst African countries. This in turn will facilitate the growth of key sectors of African economies.</p><p>Effective transport systems are key to Africa’s economic integration. By ensuring that transport systems between countries are designed in such a way that production centres are linked with distribution hubs across the continent, greater efficiencies will be created. Such integrated transport networks will allow African countries to compete effectively and, importantly, tap into regional markets.</p><p>Productivity, growth and economic competitiveness are higher in countries with effective transport infrastructure services. Effective and efficient transport infrastructure (road, rail, air, etc.) is a pre-requisite for opening up production zones in landlocked countries. Reliable road and rail transport allows companies to import and export goods. This is the case in South Africa where most of the bulk commodities for export are carried by <a href=\"http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Transnet Freight</a> rail, and 70% of consumer goods going to various destinations are transported by road.</p><p>Inadequate infrastructure in sea ports in Africa compromises the competitiveness of market centres given the fact that about 80% of the world’s trade is facilitated by sea ports linked to road and rail infrastructure. Despite the high volumes of goods that require transport, most African countries priorities road infrastructure investments over rail transport investment due to the enormous capital investment needed for rail infrastructure and rolling stock. As such, the inadequacy of transport systems cuts rural areas and marginalized communities off from market centres and makes it difficult to stimulate economic activities. </p>",
