As it ascends higher into the upper atmosphere, it cools by expansion. Coupled with decrease in the atmospheric pressure the air is further cooled so that it becomes wholly saturated. Condensation. at the point sets in, thereby forming clouds and finally rain. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/2004%2033333.jpg\" style=\"height:103px; width:200px\"></p><p><strong> (B) CONVENTIONAL RAINFALL;</strong><br>\nIt is very common in regions of great temperatures (tropics) and occurs in the day time. When the earth's surface is heated, the air expands and becomes lighter. After a long period of intensive heating, the air will be forced to rise thus carrying into the upper atmosphere water vapour.<br>\nAt the</p><p>upper atmosphere, the water vapour condenses into cumulonimbus cloud and later turns into water droplets.
