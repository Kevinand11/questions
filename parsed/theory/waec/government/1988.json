        "answer": "<p> A state is a geographical territory occupied by a group of people of different cultural background with an organised government. These people are entirely free from external control and intervention and must be ready to obey the decisions and laws of the constituted government. There is the possibility of the government using force in a state to secure obedience from the people. Examples of such states are; U. S. A., Britain, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Russia, Canada, etc.</p><p><em><strong>Characteristics of a State: The state has the following characteristics or features:</strong></em></p><p>(i) <strong><em>Permanence</em></strong>: The state is a permanent feature. Governments may change but the state remains.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Population</em></strong>: A state is occupied by people and these people make up the entire population, not animals. There is no limitation to the number of people making up a state.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>Territory</em></strong>: A state has a defined territory with clear boundaries separating it from other states. e.g. Nigeria and Benin Republic. Waters and mountains and natural resources are part of the state.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Sovereignty</em></strong>: The state possesses the supreme power that enables it to make decisions and enforce such on the people.</p><p>(v) <em><strong>Government</strong></em>: Government is a machinery set up by the state to administer the state. Government takes the political, economic, cultural and other controls on behalf of the state. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>Examine the factors which contributed to the Action Group Crises of 1962. <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><em><strong>Factors which contributed to the Action Group crises of 1962:</strong></em></p><p>(I) One of the major factors which brought about the 1962 crisis within the Action Group was mainly personality clash. This was between Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the party leader and Chief S. L Akintola, the deputy. Chief Awolowo accused Chief Akinlola of being over-ambitious and posing as the leader of the party, with the intention to possibly overthrow him as the leader of the party.</p><p>(ii) Another factor to the crises was the introduction of a new ideology into the party - democratic socialism. This innovation brought the party into two opposing camps. Democratic socialism demands mixed socialist economy, having the support of the radical group in the party. The conservatives were opposed to this ideology because it was in conflict with their interests which covered commercial and business sectors.</p><p>(iii) The issue on whether or not to join the NPC ruling party to form a national government contributed to the crises in A.G. Chief Akintola's faction supported joining the NPC in forming a national government but Chief Awolowo's faction opposed such, and preferred a working co-operation with the NCNC which they believed would help in unseating the conservative NPC from power.</p><p>(iv) Another issue in contention was the allegation against Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the then leader of opposition-in the House of Representatives. It was alleged that Chief Awolowo wanted the Premier of Western Region, Chief Akintola to consult with him before issues of importance were decided for the region. This was seen as an interference in the functions of the premier.</p><p>(v) In February 1962, A.G. had its annual congress in Jos, and decision was taken to abolish the post of a Deputy leader for the party, remove Chief Akintola as the premier of western Region and also dismiss Chief Ayo Rosiji, as the secretary of the party at the federal level. Chief S.L. Akintola, was found guilty of bad-administration, anti-party activities, disloyalty and gross indiscipline and therefore should be removed. The majority of party members in the Western Regional House of Assembly passed a vote of no confidence in the premier and presented same to the Governor, Sir Adesoji Aderemi. The Governor then had to remove Chief Akintola as the premier and he appointed Alhaji D. S. Adegbenro, the parliamentary leader in the House as the new premier. The Regional House met to ratify the decision of the executive, but turmoil broke out resulting in a free-for-all fight. It was alleged that supporters of Akintola started the fight; this was a strategy to prevent the normal conduct of the House affairs. The Police was called in and with teargas dispersed the members of the House.</p><p>(vi) With the confusion and disorder that ensued, the police had to lock up the legislative chamber on the orders of the Prime Minister. This was done as a result of the fight that came up when a second meeting was to hold. A state of emergency was declared in Western Region by the Federal government and Dr. M.A. Majekodunmi, a federal minister, was made the administrator. At the end of the emergency period, which lasted for 6 months, Chief Akintola was reinstated as the premier. In November 2 1962, ChiefAwolowo and about 30 others were charged with planning to overthrow the federal government. ChiefAwolowo was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.</p><p>(vii) The reinstatement of Chief Akintola as the Premier led to his formation of a new party called United Progressive Party (UPP) and with an alliance with some members of NCNC, formed a coalition government in the region. UPP and NCNC later became Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP). Justice G.B.A. Coker was appointed to head a commission of inquiry to investigate allegations of maladministration and misappropriation of public funds in some public corporations in the Region and at the end of the investigation, Chief Akintola, was not found guilty of such. The excising of Mid-west Region from the Western Region was another factor that led to the crises in Action Group. It should be of note that the A.G. never supported this action. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>Account for the introduction of the Indirect Rule System in Nigeria, and its failure in some parts of the country. </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong><em>(a) Britain introduced Indirect Rule in Nigeria as a result of the following factors: </em></strong></p><p>(i) <em><strong>Lack of adequate personnel;</strong></em> Lord Frederick Lugard decided to adopt this system in Nigeria due to lack of British personnel to effectively administer the vast area of Nigeria. It was argued in some quarters that few Europeans were ready to come to West Africa at this time due to the presence of insects like mosquito and tsetse flies.</p><p>(ii) <strong><em>Insufficient fund:</em></strong> Britain did not want to involve itself in an unnecessary financial responsibilities of its colonies, after involving itself in many wars earlier e.g. American war of independence.</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>The success of this system in some countries of the world: </strong></em>The system of indirect rule was successful in countries like Uganda, India, etc. So, Britain felt that, the success of it in these countries will also mean the same here in Nigeria.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Preservation of customs and traditions of the people: </em></strong>The argument advanced by Lord Lugard was that the system would help to preserve the customs and traditions of the people of Nigeria. This was why he made use of the traditional rulers and their systems in place.</p><p>(v) <em><strong>The atmosphere was favourable: </strong></em>The system was successful in Northern Nigeria because the political atmosphere was stable and favourable. The Emirs were highly respected by their people and if Britain should displace the Emirs from their position, it might attract the wrath of the people.</p><p>(vi) <strong><em>Economical to operate: </em></strong>This system was economical to operate. Britain would have expended a lot of money on paying personnel or officials to run the affairs of Nigeria as a whole.</p><p>(vii) <em><strong>Language barrier:</strong></em> This system reduced the problem posed by language. English language was not a language spoken by Nigerians and so adopting an indirect approach in administration would reduce this problern.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>Large expanse of land:</em></strong> The large areas of Nigeria contributed to the adoption of indirect rule system.</p><p>(ix) <strong><em>Involving traditional rulers:</em></strong> Lord Lugard saw the need of bringing in traditional rulers in the art of administration, isolating them might not produce a good and stable administration.</p><p><strong><em>(b) The system of Indirect Rule was successful in Northern Nigeria, partially successful in the West and a complete failure in the East, as a result of the following:</em></strong></p><p>(i) <strong><em>Appointment of Warrant Chiefs:</em></strong> The Obiship institution was not properly defined in the East the British officials had to appoint Chiefs, otherwise known as Warrant Chiefs, without consulting the people. These Chiefs were highhanded and not acceptable to the people. Most of their activities were outrageous and that was one of the causes of Aba women's riot of 1929.</p><p>(ii)<strong><em> Political administration practised:</em></strong> Igbo political system is based on decentralization of administration and cannot accommodate the indirect rule system which could mostly work on a centralised administration.</p><p>(iii) <strong><em>No properly defined system of Taxation: </em></strong>The system of tax payment and collection was not properly defined in the East as compared to that obtainable in the Hausa/Fulani political system. These inadequacies made the execution of some projects by the British impossible.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Non-inclusion of educated elites: </strong></em>The educated elites were not included in the administration. Instead, the British preferred the illiterates as warrant chiefs and this sparked off protests and rejection of the system by the elites.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>The importance of education:</em></strong> The educated citizens in the east were able to question the essence or relevance of an alien system that had no moral justification.</p><p>(vi) <em><strong>Religion</strong></em>: Christianity was a dominant religion in the east and had a western democratic orientation. It helped in bringing down indirect rule system in the west.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Small size of the units: </em></strong>The units in the igbo political system were too small compared to other systems e.g. the Hausa/Fulani emirate system.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>The people were not submissive:</em></strong> Their failure to submit to the rulers was because their rulers were imposed on them. Igbo political system is egalitarian and decentralised, and so they detest authoritarianism.</p><p>(ix) <em><strong>The system was an intruder: </strong></em>Since the people's tradition was abused and neglected, this led to the failure of indirect rule system. </p>",
