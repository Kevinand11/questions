Through different happenings and observations, the child learns and imbibes the political behaviour of his parents. His future political attitudes and inclinations are determined at family unit.</p><p>(ii) <em><strong>School</strong></em>: Educational institutions play vital role in educating people about the issues of politics in a country.

Even grants from both the state and central governments did not bring a relief because they have too many functions to perform and they cannot raise enough revenue internally.</p><p>(iii) <em><strong>Political interference: </strong></em>It was argued that constant political interference from the government has added impetus to the ineffectiveness of the local government. Such interference has in recent times led to the appointment of persons to positions mainly as a result of party leaning and support.</p><p>(iv) <strong><em>Embezzlement of funds:</em></strong> Most of the officials in local governments add to the problems of local government by misappropriating and embezzling funds meant for projects.</p><p>(v) <strong><em>Bribery and corruption: </em></strong>These evils have succeeded in making local government inefficient and ineffective. Some of the officials are deep-rooted in corrupt practices like abuse of power, kickbacks, inflating contracts and poor execution. (vi) Absence of infrastructure: Absence of infrastructure, e.g. electricity, good roads, housing projects for the workers, etc., has resulted in numerous prob-lems in local governments.</p><p>(vii) <strong><em>Interference from traditional rulers: </em></strong>Some of the traditional rulers feel that the role played by local government officials are supposed to be performed by them. So, there is regular interference in the affairs of local government by traditional rulers. This brings about distortions in the performance of local government functions.</p><p>(viii) <strong><em>Illiterate officials/councilors:</em></strong> Most of the councilors are not properly educated.

This affects their effective performance.</p><p>(x) <strong><em>Nepotism and favouritism: </em></strong>Award of contracts and appointments are not based on merits. Nepotism and favouritism are playing defective roles in the affairs of local government as they are counterproductive.</p><p>(xi) <strong><em>Partisan politics: </em></strong>The involvement of local government officials in partisan politics instead of their official duties is bound to affect the effective performance of the local governments.</p><p>(xii) <strong><em>Ineffective method of collecting rates: </em></strong>The method used in the collection of rates is not modern but crude. Evidence has shown that many people evade paying their rates and taxes, this affects the much expected fund coming into the coffers of the local government. <br>\n </p>",
