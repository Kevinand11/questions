        "question": "<p>A youth club in your country is organizing an essay competition for final year Senior Secondary School students on the topic: The lingua franca question: problems and prospects. Write your entry.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF LINGUA FRANCA IN NIGERIA. </p><p>      A lingua franca is a language used for common communication among peoples of a country with diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds like Nigeria, For instance. in some countries in East Africa like Tanzania and Kenya, Swahili has been adopted as the lingua franca. A lingua franca is supposed to be a language accepted and adopted by a country and spoken among natives who have their different native languages. <br>\n      In Nigeria, presently, the language which can be regarded as the lingua franca is the English language, the language of the colonizers. English language has served the country over the years as both the official language and the lingua franca. However, Nigeria, as a multi-ethnic country with diverse cultural and linguistic affinities needs a lingua franca even if it means throwing off the last yoke of colonialism by replacing English language with a lingua famca. <br>\n      A. lingua franca can do a lot of good for the country. As a means of effective communication among all tribes and ethnic groups in the country, a lingua franca will promote unity and harmony. When there is a common language spoken by all the. ethnic groups in Nigeria, there is every tendency that the various ethnic languages and dialects will be de-emphasized. This will lead to people in the country regarding one another as brothers and sisters. It will facilitate easy communication and understanding. <br>\n      In addition, a lingua franca is a leveller. It is a language spoken by both the rich and the poor. the noble and the peasants. A lingua franca bridges the yearning gap between the rich and the poor as it is natural that the person one shares a language with is one's brother. <br>\n      Furthermore, a lingua franca is desirable for national integrity. A country with a distinguished lingua franca is identified with the language and as such. it is respected among comity of nations. In fact, other nations look down on a nation which uses another country's language as its lingua franca. It is even worse if the lingua franca is the language of a coloniser. <br>\n      The adoption of a lingua franca could be fraught with a lot of problems. The first problem is that of acceptance. The ethnic groups always cling to their different native languages which they regard as their mother tongues. As a result of this, making them to accept a lingua franca may mean to them dropping their mother tongues for another language. <br>\n      The second problem is that in Nigeria. the several ethnic groups always associate the number of the speakers of their ethnic languages with population. They believe that languages have to do with geographical spread and thus, they resist every attempt to undermine the use of their native languages. <br>\n      Nigeria needs to have a national lingua franca policy as a matter of urgency. If the country could gradually and assiduously pursue a policy on lingua franca. a language could emerge out of the various ethnic languages we have. A lingua franca is always a melange of the two or more languages, especially the languages of the minority groups. I am sure that if a lingua franca emerges out of the languages of the minority ethnic groups in Nigeria, such lingua franca will be nationally accepted and it would not be regarded by other major ethnic groups as local imperialism. </p>",

You know that it is always my habit to wait for a reply to my letter before writing another one but I decided to write now because of a terrible storm which heralded the arrival of the first rain this year destroyed many houses in Kano, and unfortunately. our family house was among the houses destroyed and left devastated by the storm. <br>\n      It all started as a gathering dark cloud in the sky and everybody was expecting a refreshing time from the heat which had almost smothered down life out of the people for some time now. The clouds gathered for a period of almost two hours after which there was this terrible storm which started blowing heavily across the city. In a little time, it became so intolerable and violent that what started as a mere wind grew to become a great cyclone blowing off the roofs of so many houses. It blew off windows and doors of many other houses thus rendering them unsafe for the in-coming rain. <br>\n      The terrible storm affected our family house badly. It blew off the roof and pulled down parts of the wall. We had to pack out all the family belongings and look for another house in our neighbourhood to sleep that night. Uncle, the family has no house to live in: we are now squatting with a friend of our father. <br>\n      Therefore, it is necessary that you should offer a help to us so that the house can be reconstructed. In other words. the family is expecting you to send some money to us for the reconstruction of the house. Our father is old now and it won't be proper for them to be squatting in another man's house. I'll be happy if you can handle the matter with the urgency that it requires. <br>\n      How is your work and family? I hope that things are going on very well. Extend my sincere greetings to your wife, Tayo, Olu and the little Dupe. I hope to hear from you very soon. <br>\n                                                                                                                                   Yours sincerely, <br>\n                                                                                                                                   Taiwo. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Write an article suitable for publication in a foreign magazine on the traditional marriage system of your people.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                      THE TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE SYSTEM OF THE YORUBA PEOPLE. <br>\n      The traditional marriage system of my tribe, the Yorubas is i different from what is obtained nowadays among the i people of other tribes. The system is interesting and error free if it is followed strictly as a process of getting married. However, the infiltration of the western culture has affected the traditional marriage system, just as it has affected other cultural and traditional systems in Africa. <br>\n      In the traditional marriage system of the Yoruba people, a man does not just get engaged to a woman or goes into courtship simply because they happen to meet on the road or in a party fortuitously. A man's marriage to a woman is a gradual process through which a man systematically, as it were, gets interested in a woman and works his way towards achieving his aim. <br>\n      In Yoruba land, a woman can be bestowed to a man when the woman was still a baby, but then the man has to convince the family of the woman that he is of a good character. There are lots of things considered before a man can get a woman to marry as a wife among my people. He has to come from a good family lineage which does not have a trace of inherited diseases and which has been known to possess some attractable virtues worthy of such association as marriage. <br>\n      It is worthwhile to note that in the Yoruba traditional marriage system. a man wooes a woman through \"alarinna\" the traditional marriage counsellor and intermediary. who will go to declare the affections of a would-be suitor to the would-be bride. The 'alarinna' who is usually a matured woman in the society, and in most cases not a member of any of the families involved, always serves as the counsellor and the intermediary. She goes about to find out the facts about the two families and makes the desire of the man known to the woman. <br>\n      After the woman must have consented through the 'alarinna'. the man is not free to visit the woman because the `alarinna' will now have to go further to get the consent of the family of the woman. It is after the family of the woman has consented and given its tacit agreement that the man and the woman can be said to be engaged. The agreement will even come after the two families must have investigated each other and found out that they both have good lineage. <br>\n      The open expression of the agreement starts when the family of the man visits the parents of the woman to publicly declare that there is a beautiful \"flower\", which metaphorically means the woman. in their compound that they want to pluck. It is after this first visit that a date will be fixed for the traditional engagement ceremony where the nuptial knot will be tied. <br>\n      The traditional engagement ceremony is the culmination of the process which begins either when the woman was bestowed to the man while she was a baby. mostly as an indication of friendship between the two families, or when he sees the woman as a matured adult and goes through the intermediary. Whichever way. the traditional engagement ceremony is always very colourful and interesting. The two families get prepared for the day when they will come together to give the woman to the man. <br>\n      Among my people, before a woman can be regarded as the wife of a man. the man will have to pay the bride price known as \"owo ori\" and other charges such as \"owo idana\". along with other marriage gifts like some tubers of yam, schnapps gin and others. When the family is satisfied with what the man's family has offered that they will join them together as husband and wife. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Kunle sodiya. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    OIBS. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    lbadan. </p>",

I bought a 12-band International World Receiver radio from your store six months ago. The model number of the radio is 2251-8439. <br>\n      When I bought the radio, I was given a two-year guarantee and the foreman assured me that the radio will not develop any fault for at least two years. However. two weeks ago the radio developed a fault. The fault is that the radio just stopped suddenly to receive when tuned on two of its wave bands The two bands are the F.M. and short wave bands. These two bands are very important to me because 1 always enjoy the music of the various F.M. local stations and through the short wave. I also listen to the British Broadcasting Service (BBS) and the Voice of America (VOA). <br>\n      I have reported the fault to the foreman but he refused to listen to my complaint claiming that the two-year guarantee did not cover the fault I reported. Other efforts I made to let the foreman agree with me met with a great rebuff. <br>\n      I am writing you formally to bring to your notice what had transpired between the foreman and me before this time. I would want your store to honour its guarantee to me when I bought the radio by repairing it. If your store obliges to repair the radio, it would do a lot to redeem the image of your business outfit. <br>\n      I would be grateful if you could investigate the matter and use your good office to make the store fulfill its obligation. <br>\n                                                                                                                                  Yours faithfully. <br>\n                                                                                                                                  (signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                  Adekunle Ajibade. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                                                                               A BITTER EXPERIENCE <br>\n      Francis was my classmate in secondary school. During our secondary school days, we were very close and intimate. We were close friends to the extent that we used to exchange visits and my parents knew Francis very well and his parents too knew me. While in school, we shared many things together and we left the school the same year. <br>\n      When we left secondary school. Francis and I still maintained our friendship for some years. While he was working in an insurance  company, I worked with a government research institute and we shared the same apartment since we were both unmarried. The opportunity we had to live together further cemented our relationship and we did most things together. <br>\n      Few years. after this, Francis had the opportunity to travel out of the country and we exchanged letters for the first two years of his stay overseas before I heard nothing again about him. Some years after this, I resigned my appointment to take to business of buying and selling. I got married and my wife and I joined hands to set up a business outfit. We were doing very fine as we were selling agricultural produce. <br>\n      Three years after my separation with Francis, he came back to Nigeria and he was able to locate me. was very happy to see him and .l introduced him to my wife who readily accepted Francis as our family friend. Francis told me that he had gone into. business and that since I was a businessman, we could transact business together. This is how we started Joint. business outfit with the hope that Francis' connection overseas will be of immense assistance and leverage since his wife is an American. <br>\n      Francis went on several business trips on behalf of our joint business venture which made my wife and Ito have a i trust in him. His assurance that nothing could go wrong and because of our long standing friendship made me not to listen to the warning of my wife. My wife had always warned me against being too trusting and her advice that I should make effort to follow Francis abroad so that I could know where Francis always buys the goods. <br>\n      After two years of business transactions Francis came down to Nigeria and told me that there is a business transaction which we could do together. The business, according to him, involves importing a large number of electrical equipment which will cost two million naira. He asked me to raise one million naira and that he would add the remaining one million naira. <br>\n      Despite my wife's warning against going into the business with such colossal sum of money, I decided to sell some of our properties and borrowed money without her knowledge. I gave the money to Francis and he travelled out to America. <br>\n      I waited for six months expecting Francis to come back with the electrical equipment. After six months, I received a note from Francis and in the note, I read these horrible words: \"I AM NOW A MILLIONAIRE, GO TO BLAZES. DON'T LOOK FOR ME, YOU ARE A SUCKER\". I collapsed after reading the note. It was a bitter experience, but I learnt my lesson.</p>",

I welcome you all to this memorable occasion which provides me a golden opportunity to address you all. First and foremost, my special thanks go to the almighty God who has spared our lives till today. I must not fail to express my deep appreciation to all members of this club for their contributions in one way or the other. I am also excited for your full support towards the successful organization of this Annual General Meeting (AGM). <br>\n      The chairman and my distinguished audience, I want to crave your indulgence to tell you a short history of our great club. The club, Greenleaves Youth Club was established six years ago. At its early stage, most youths regarded it as a time wasting club that would soon die off. but today the club has been able to record tremendous achievements. <br>\n      Firstly, our club has helped the community in so many ways. Before the inception of the club, our community had no good hospital I can remember that few years back, no fewer than one hundred people died of malaria fever in this community. Our community is about forty kilometres to the nearest city where our people can obtain good medical treatment. As a result of this, our club contributed money and raised fund for the building of a standard hospital for the community. Today. we thank God that the great edifice where our people can obtain medical treatment has been donated by our club to be used by the hospital In addition to that, we paid the salaries of the doctors, nurses and other auxiliary officials of the hospital for six months before it was finally handed over to the state government. <br>\n      Secondly, we have constructed and tarred a few roads in the community. The only road which links our rural community to the nearest city was expanded and tarred while four streets were constructed and tarred Presently, we are still working on some other ones.<br>\n      Similarly, for over two decades there was no standard market in this community. There was no place of contact between buyers and sellers and in the real sense of it there was nothing like the exchange of goods and services. In most cases. the agricultural products of our farmers got spoiled. but today our club has been able to establish a standard market for the community where farmers can sell their products.<br>\n      However. in spite of all the achievements during my tenure as the president of this club, I also encountered a lot of problems. Actually. as expected. the major problem I encountered was lack of fund The club was financially handicapped especially when we were embarking on some of the capital projects mentioned earlier on. Definitely, we would have achieved more if we had much more funds at our disposal. <br>\n      In conclusion. I thank all members of this club once again for the job well done. Our club has achieved a lot of recordable progress in this community. the financial crunch notwithstanding. As the President, I urge all our members to wake up anew and gear up to achieve more this year. My thanks go to all distinguished guests here present. Thank you and God bless.<br>\n <br>\n                                                                                                                                  Thomas Israel, <br>\n                                                                                                                                  President, Greenleaves Youth Club</p>",

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.</p><p>      It is now fashionable to hear discussions centering on the disproportionate representation of males and females in the population. it is indeed not uncommon to hear people say that for every man there are about two or three women; so, every man can marry more than one woman. This theory is, of course, more popular among adherents who favour the seeming glamour of the polygamous way of life. The big question is: 'How correct is this theory?' And what are the facts?</p><p>      The stark reality is that in any normal population out of every one hundred conceptions, about fifty-three to fifty-five are for boys, and about forty-five to forty-seven are for girls. So, there are potentially more boys than girls in any normal population. However, because of many factors, some of which are not fully clear, the foetus of a boy is far more fragile than that of a girl. So, there are more miscarriages of male children than of female ones. So, by the time the children are born, the ratio between boys and girls has been reduced to about fifty-two boys to forty-eight girls.</p><p>      As infants, boys are more delicate than girls. Boys are less resistant to certain killer diseases and girls thus have a higher chance of survival. The result is that before adolescence, at about the age of between nine and eleven years, boys and girls are virtually at par in the population.</p><p>      Throughout adolescence, from the age of twelve to nineteen years, boys continue to fall victim of many ailments at a much higher degree than girls do, Besides, boys' tendency to be more adventurous, more daring and more risk-taking, expose them far more to mishaps. Some of these do reduce their representation in the population. So, by the end of the age of adolescence, there are slightly more girls than boys. The reduction, thereafter, in the number of males continues progressively. Men are the breadwinners, the soldiers and the travellers. It is during their middle age that very many men die tragically, as soldiers in their boots, so to say. The net result of this is that by the time they are in the mind-thirties and forties, there are more women than men.</p><p>      Finally, in their late forties and fifties, far more men than women die of cardiac diseases like hypertension. heart-attack and anxiety. This is the period when there are clearly more widows than widowers.</p><p>      On the whole, therefore, there are more females than males but certainly not in the proportion claimed by adherents of polygamy. During their marriageable years, there are about eleven wives to ten husbands-that is husbands and wives of the same age. That in some communities one man could marry as many as fifteen wives is a result of the fact that men normally marry from among the ladies younger than they are. This, more than any other factor. allows some men who are inclined to polygamy to have their way.</p><p>(a) In five sentences, one for each factor, summarize the factors responsible for the progressive reduction in the number o' f males as against females from conception to adulthood.</p><p>(b) In one sentence, state why some form of polygamy is possible in a normal population.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) (i) There are more miscarriages of male foetus than the female's <br>\n(ii) More boys get killed by killer diseases at infancy. <br>\n(iii) At adolescent age, boys become victims of ailments at a higher rate than the girls <br>\n(iv) More males die during hazardous business and professional engagement. <br>\n(v) More men between the ages of forty and sixty die of heart related diseases than women <br>\n(b) Some form of polygamy is possible in a normal population because the men normally marry women who are younger than them. </p>",
