        "question": "<p>Write an article suitable for publication in a national newspaper on the menace of secret cults in our schools and colleges.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>This study was undertaken to establish the reasons why students in higher educational institutions in Delta State of Nigeria join secret cults on the campuses, the effects of the incidence, and the strategies to employ to eradicate it from the institutions. It was a descriptive survey in design, and using a systematic, proportionate random sample of 665 students, 220 lecturers and 115 school administrators in the state-owned University, three Colleges of Education and three Polytechnics, who duly completed a closed-ended and open-ended 31-item questionnaire, the study confirmed the supposition that students join secret cults in the institutions to terrorize lecturers to pass their courses at all cost, and to provide security services to new initiates and shield them from oppressive students and the perceived hostility of wicked lecturers. A number of effects of the secret cults in the institutions were also established, some of these being cultism leading to certificates not being backed up with true academic struggle, and this leading to reduction in manpower quality; by design, cultists seriously abusing hard drugs like cocaine and alcohol, and in that state of mind, committing heinous crimes; identified and expelled cultists possibly becoming school drop-outs, robbers, prostitutes, drug-peddlers and maladjusted people in life; and cultists spearheading riots at the slightest opportunity and in the process looting and causing damage to school property. It was then concluded that the solution to the menace of secret cults in the institutions rests with evolving a broad based approach which should involve all stakeholders–students, lecturers, institutions’ authorities and government.</p>",

I hope you are doing great over there in Kaduna? I have missed you and I Know tnat the feeling is mutual. Anyway, as you already know that I hold the position of the Library Prefect in my school, I wish to share my experiences with you.<br>\n        As you already know that I love reading, I was made the Library Prefect upon reaching SS3 class. As the Library Prefect, It is my duty to assist the Librarian when necessary. My duties include handling the borrowing and returning of books in the school library. I ensure that all the books in the library are accounted for. I make sure that every borrowed book is well documented and the names and classes of the borrowers are taken down. Doing this daily has helped me to be more accountable, I pay attention to details as a result of this role.<br>\n         One of my duties is to maintain orderliness in the library. Whenever students are in the library seeking for books to read, ensure it is done in an orderly manner. Some students, especially the JSS One students have no idea how the books are arranged on each shelf, despite the indications on them. What I do in such situations is to lead them to the appropriate section, while advising them on the type of books to read.<br>\n         When students are done reading, I ensure that the shelves are well-arranged and the library tidy always. I do this with the help of the school librarian, she advises from her wealth of experience. Doing this also made me more responsible as I learnt that responsibility comes from being given a role of leadership.<br>\n          I wish i could keep on writing but I have to stop here. I hope you will share your own experiences with me as the Labour Prefect soon. My regards to your parents and siblings.<br>\n                                                                                                      Yours sincerely,<br>\n                                                                                                       Folarin.                                                                                                                    </p>",

        "question": "<p>Write an article suitable for publication in a national newspaper on the growing incidence of drug abuse among the youth, stating the causes and suggesting ways it can be curbed.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                  <strong> DRUG ABUSE AMONG THE YOUTH</strong><br>\n      Drug abuse is the misuse or over-dependence on drugs or substances. Abuse of drug is more common among youths all over the world. Some of the narcotics and psychotropic drugs include : cannabis, cocaine, heroine, codeine, tramadol and so on. Those who abuse these drugs depend on them and cannot function optimally except they take them.<br>\n       Drug abuse can be caused by a number of mental illnesses such as depression and bipolar disorders. These disorders may cause people to resort to drugs to manage the symptoms. When these drugs are used, there is a momentary escape from their problems until a relapse occurs.<br>\n        Peer influence is also one of the leading causes of drug abuse among youths. When a young person sees his or her peers taking something and then feeling better afterwards, such youth will likely engage in such. It is easier for youths to be influenced by friends because they want to experiment and impress until it becomes an addiction they are unable to break free from.<br>\n        Another cause of drug abuse is unstable family background. A young person who lacks family attention are more likely to abuse drugs. When there is no parent-child relationship, substance abuse is most likely inevitable and such children usually find solace in drug misuse. Also, children whose parents abuse drugs are likely to follow suit as they won't see it as wrong.<br>\n       In order for drug abuse to be curbed to its barest minimum, youths have to be educated on the negative ettects of abusing drugs especially for those who haven't engaged in it already. The country's drug laws should be reviewed in earnest so as to create suitable penalties for offenders. This should be put in place after proper enlightenment of citizens. Doing this will curb drug abuse among the youths to a large percentage.<br>\n                                                                                                           Ayo Kingsley.</p>",

I am writing to give an account of the recent school fight and also to prove Damola Oyebade's innocence to the school authorities.<br>\n       It all started out as an argument in our class Senior Secondary School three Emerald. A boy named Bassey Ntoyo had eariier been flogged by Mr. Bright, the Biology teacher for failing his test. An argument ensued in class about Mr. Bright's partiality in awarding marks in his tests. Bassey accused Damola of not deserving the mark he got, this made Damola respond angrily to the accusation. They began to insult each other and Bassey slapped Damola first while the latter retaliated. It soon became a free for all fight when their friends waded in.<br>\n         When l discovered that the situation was becoming uncontrollable. I alerted our class teacher Miss Dumebi. She tried to put an end to the fight but they did not pay attention to her. She immediately left the class to get the Vice-principal to intervene but before she got back, Bassey had stabbed one of Damola's friends Ogojesu. The fight came to an abrupt end when Ogojesu started bleeding. He was rushed to the school clinic and was latter taken to the hospital in the town.<br>\n          The Vice Principal and Miss Dumebi alerted the school management. Damola and Bassey were both expelled without proper hearing. Sir, I am pleading on behalf of Damola because everyone knows him to be highly intelligent and respectful. These character traits earned him the position of the school's Chaplain Prefect. He was wrongly accused by Bassey and only retaliated by slapping Bassey back. Bassey is a known bully and has never been serious with his academics. He has once been suspended and now expelled for possession of weapons.<br>\n          I hope that this report would be enough proof of Damola's innocence in the fight. He has never been found in such situation and was only provoked by Bassey. I hope that with this, Damola would be recalled and reinstated as the school's Chaplain Prefect. Thank you for your understanding and patience. <br>\n                                                                                                       Yours faithfully,<br>\n                                                                                                        Ayo Obakpe</p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>THE CHALLENGES OF PREFECTSHIP: A SPEECH BY THE OUTGOING HEAD GIRL</strong> <br>\n     A beautiful afternoon to the Principal, the parents, teachers, my fellow prefects and students of Victory High School. It is my honour to stand before this gathering today to welcome you all to the valedictory service for the outgoing students of this reputable citadel of learning.<br>\n     Prefectship is a leadership role for students and as J. Donald Walters said \"Leadership is an opportunity to Serve. It is not a trumpet call to self importance'\". It has been an experience worthwhile and I wish to address this august gathering in some ot the Challenges usually encountered by prefects. Prefects are expected to live up to the expectations of the school as well as that of fellow students.<br>\n     One of the difficulties encountered by the prefects is getting the students to obey instructions from us. Even as prefects, some heady students don't respect us and refuse to comply until teachers intervene. Some of these students hold grudges after these encounters while some even go as far as threatening us for doing our duties.<br>\n     As prefects, we are to ensure that the school is not rowdy. Some students are fond of noise-making while some students derive pleasure from roaming about after recess is over. As the school prefects, we have to leave our classes to ensure there is no loitering. After each recess, we leave our classes to make sure students attend their classes. This wasn't easy at first but we got used to it with time.<br>\n     Prefectship comes with a lot of responsibilities and combining these responsibilities with academics hasn't been easy because we have to act as role models to the junior students. Teachers as well have high expectations of us; for instance, we are expected to be in school as early as 7:00am not withstanding what we may be facing as individuals.<br>\n     Before I step down as the head girl, I would like to appreciate the school authorities for entrusting us with such delicate roles and amazing leadership opportunities. And to the incoming prefects, I hope you will continue to raise the bar high so as to move the school to greater heights.</p><p>              Thank you everyone.</p>",

As a young girl, I had everything gong on for me. I was intelligent and from an average family. My parents ensured that I did not lack anything. I had always been at the top right from my primary school days till secondary school. It all began when I gained admission into Maybelline University, Accra.<br>\n       My first year in the university was smooth and I succeeded in warding off every distraction. In my second year, i moved into a different hostel and there, I met three girls who were a year ahead of me. The girls were Ayo, Mabel and sharon. I noticed that these girls were very close and they all had something in common which was unseriousness. They hardly attend lectures and barely sleep in the hostel. I made sure that i didn't get too close to them or ask silly questions. To get me interested, they were always talking about how rich they are. They flaunted new bags, shoes and assessories.<br>\n      One fateful day, my curiousity got the better of me and I decided to follow them to Sharon's birthday party. She said her boyfriend wanted to celebrate it for her and that we will be back before night fall. Kunle her boyfriend was already waiting outside in his car. We got to the hotel after about an hour. I was introduced to a young man called Daniel. We exchanged contacts and things kicked off pretty soon between the two of us. I went to clubs several times With Daniel, after that day.<br>\n      After some months, I became pregnant and I felt that Daniel would be happy about it since he promised to marry me. I visited him in his house to inform him the same day I got tested only to meet the greatest surprise of my life. I met a young lady in his house who introduced herself as Daniel's fiancee. I was shocked beyond words when I heard that. To worsen the situation, Daniel came out soon after to confirm her words. He denied knowing me when she asked him who I was. At that moment, i felt like vanishing into thin air. I couldn't even tell him what I wanted to; I opened my mouth but words wouldn't come out. I turned and went back to my hostel in shame. I took a few of my clothes and went home for the semester break.<br>\n      At home, I kept vomitting and was taken to the hospital where I was confirmed pregnant. My parents were disappointed as i didn't even have anyone to present as the father of my child. I remembered all the Christian upbringing I had as a child. Alas! I thought to myself, how I wish I had listened to my parents.</p>",

Occasionally, he would work till late evening as a labourer on someone's farmland. Returning, he would bring home pepper, vegetables and firewood. Interestingly, he had a father, who spend more time working from cockcrow till dusk on large commercial farmlands. Interestingly, he had a father who had his own farm, but was too poor to finance his education. Once in a while, he would go to his father's farm to help the old man out.<br>\n        However, towards the end of his first year in senior secondary school. he obtained a piece of farm land  from his father.

At first, an uncle introduced me to working on other people's farms. but when I discovered <em><ins>that I could take care of myself</ins>.</em> I worked even harder. When there was no work anywhere.

        "question": "<p><em>Read the following passage<strong> carefully</strong> and answer the questions on it: </em><br>\n      The issue of youth delinquency has become a major concern to everyone. Hardly a day passes by without reports of some youth  being involved in one act of lawlessness or the other. In view' of the fact that the youth of today will take over the mantle of leadership in future, the multimillion dollar question is: Are we guaranteed a safe future? We often wonder what has changed; what has happened to the respectful, obedient and studious youth of the not too distant past?<br>\n     At the ceremony held recently, a renowned religious leader was very worried about the youth. He asked parents to be careful of \"the new armed robbers and carriers of immorality\" they had introduced into their homes. In his opinion, to protect their children, parents have done well by building high walls around their houses and fencing them with electric barbed wire. But the new \"robbers\" they should look out for are the television and the Internet they leave their children with all the time without Supervision. These modern technologies offer sites where children pick up some unsavoury habits and behavior. <br>\n        Gradually, consciously or unconsciously, the television and the Internet have assumed a central role in the lives of many children. They hardly miss their parents whether they are at home or not because they are engrossed in watching television or browsing the Internet. There is rarely any interaction between parents and their children. Some children forgo their meals in order to watch particular programmers on television or browse the Internet. Continuous struggle among siblings for the possession ot the remote control is a constant sight in most homes. Parents who can afford it solve this problem by acquiring additional television sets.<br>\n       Some children sit in front of the television with textbooks and notebooks before them, pretending to study. They know every programme at any given time on almost all the channels. Ask them to do any academic work and their countenance immediately shows a complete lack of interest. As they watch one programme after the other on the various channels, children may absorb materials that are unsuitable for their formative years.<br>\n       Thanks to the television and the Internet, their active way of life has been reduced to the minimum. Some children sit for hours watching television or browsing the Internet while they stuff themselves with popcorn, cookies and sweets. This sedentary lifestyle affects their health. No wonder we now have obese teenagers.<br>\n      However, the television and the Internet have their positive sides. They are great sources of information, learning and entertainment. They help in the development of our social roles and behaviour and kill boredom. If only parents could find time to participate in what their children do and watch and guide them, the future may not seem so bleak. When children are encouraged and guided to watch child-friendly programmes, a healthy balance can be created between watching the television., browsing the Internet and engaging in other household and community activities. Above all, parents should be more assertive and wrench their parental responsibilities from the mass media.<br>\n(a) In four sentences, one for each, summarize the effects of the excessive use of the television and the Internet on children.<br>\n(b) In two sentences, one for each, summarize how the dangers posed by the television and the Internet can be overcome.</p>",
