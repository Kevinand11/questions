I hope you are doing fine. I hope too that you are settling down to your new position as a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly. I thank God for the opportunity that you have to be a successful politician in the state. The last time you visited Ilugun, I was busy in my school. When I got home to hear that you came, I felt aggrieved because I had been looking for an opportunity to see you. If I had met you during your visit, it wouldn't have been necessary to write you this letter.</p><p>      Uncle, the purpose of writing this letter is to inform you that need your moral and financial assistance to accomplish what I intend to do after my Senior Secondary School Examination. As you know, there is little that my father can do for me after my secondary education. He is a poor farmer whose influence does not .go beyond the confines of our small village. Therefore. I'll need your assistance in all that I intend to do. I am sure that as a legislator and politician, you now wield a lot of influence in Lagos State.</p><p>      The first help I want from you is to live with you after my secondary school education Since there are limited opportunities in our village. I intend to come down to Lagos. This will enable me to broaden my horizon. Secondly, I will be able to take the advantage of the several opportunities that abound in Lagos in order to improve myself.</p><p>      The second help I want from you is employment. I don't want to be idle while living with you. so I want you to assist me in looking for a job. The job will keep me busy and at the same time it will enable me to save some money for higher education. In addition, if I have a job, I'll be able to provide some things for myself which means, not be depending on you for everything I need. I am sure that getting me a job will not be difficult for you, considering your influential position as a politician and a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly.</p><p>      Another area I would need your assistance is in sponsoring my education in higher institution. I just want to work for a year or two after which I intend to study law in the University of Lagos. When admitted into the school, I'll need your financial assistance as law is not a course for a pauper like me. One has to have a good financial backing and I count on you for assistance in this aspect.</p><p>      There is nobody I can turn to since my father is getting older everyday. Therefore, I rely solely on you and I know that you'll understand my position and assist. My father sends his greetings. Extend my greetings to your wife and children. I hope Bola and Tunde are doing well in their studies. I hope to read from you very soon.</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Yours sincerely,</p><p>                                                                                                             </p>",

        "question": "<p>You have just returned to the city from your village where you spent the last holiday. In an article suitable for publication in your school magazine, compare life in your village with that in the city.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>      Ever since my return from our village where I spent my last holiday, I have been longing for an opportunity to pay another visit. Life is more pleasurable in the village than in Lagos. The quality of life in the village has forced me to abandon my earlier assumption that there was no life outside Lagos. <br>\n      To say the least, real life exists only in our villages, if what I experienced in our village is anything to go by Everything about the village is simple. Apart from the fresh air and the vegetation, food and water are fresh. The food is not synthetic as in Lagos. Throughout m stay, I ate fresh food and fruits. My grandmother procured all the ingredients with which she cooked my meals from the e farm. She would grind the pepper on her grinding-stone which makes her soup more delicious and tastier than the ones prepared by my mother because she uses blender. Fruits like pawpaw, orange and pine-apple are allowed to ripe before they are plucked for eating. This is not so in Lagos and other cities as these fruits are plucked unripe and buried to force them to ripe. Food items are in abundance and very cheap unlike Lagos where they are very costly. <br>\n      The scenery of the village is better imagined than to be told. Unlike in the city where houses are crowded together, huts are built in a way that flow of air is not obstructed. Much more air circulates in the village than in the city. This makes the villagers to be more healthy than city-dwellers. The huts are built wide apart. This makes cross ventilation possible. The whole village is built on a beautiful landscape and naturally in a way that makes the entire scenery of the village more beautiful than the city. <br>\n      Human lives and property are more secured in my village than Lagos. I can remember that I forgot my clothes which I had washed and spread on the grass beside my grandmother's but and went to sleep one night. The following morning, the clothes were still intact, where I had spread them. My grandmother told me that nobody would steal them even if they were there for months. There was no incident of theft or robbery throughout the period of my stay in the village. The phenomenal incidences of abduction and killing of human beings to make money do not occur in my village. Everybody is a good neighbour as the people live peacefully with one another. They are more contented than those who are living in the city. They are not in a hurry to acquire wealth, though they are very hardworking. <br>\n      My village people have good conduct and morals. The children do not misbehave unlike in the city where children turn to hooliganism and other immoral acts. They are properly taught and trained in ethics. Every evening before we go to bed, we would gather outside my grandmother's but and she would tell us stories which have good moral lessons. <br>\n      The elders, unlike those in the city, are never in a hurry to pass by without words of greetings and blessing. They will ask after your family and health endlessly. In the city, this is not obtainable as everybody goes his or her way every morning without caring to utter a word of greeting. <br>\n      I enjoyed my brief stay in my village because I felt relaxed without any anxiety or fear for anything. I had put on so much weight by the time I returned to Lagos. My health improved greatly as I ate to my satisfaction I was not really happy by the time I had to come back, though I had to because school was about to resume. </p><p> </p>",

The junior students had been complaining about the high handedness with which the senior students. especially the SS3 students, handled any misunderstanding between the junior students and the senior. The senior students were given too much power to punish the junior ones. They were authorized to use canes and belts on any junior student who they considered erring. Recently, a JSS3 student was beaten up by some SS3 students for a reason that was not justifiable In the course of the beating the student was injured in the eye. The case was reported to the principal and nothing was done about it. <br>\n      Secondly, the school authority was insensitive to the demands of the students. The students had earlier asked for improvement in the quality of the food they were being given in the hostel. Students in the boarding house were forced to eat beans four times in a week and despite the huge amount of money collected from their parents fruits and other beverages that were hitherto served during meals were stopped. The students were infuriated by the sudden removal of fruits and beverages from their menu table. <br>\n      Sir, what really ignited the seething anger which had been suppressed for long was the acute shortage of water. We woke up that day to notice that there was no water in the school. We decided to go to the stream to fetch water for bathing. On our way to the stream a student was injured by his pail when we were trying to climb a hill. This incident sparked up a protest march to the principal's office. The protest march became violent and uncontrollable when some teachers and some prefects tried to force the protesting students to retreat to their hostels and the protesting students then became violent and began to damage the school property. <br>\n      It is now three months since the school has been under lock and key. I am therefore appealing to you to order the school to be reopened. We have suffered enough and have learnt a lot of lessons. I would sincerely appreciate it if you could use your good offices to re-open the school so that those of us who are innocent could be spared the traumatic experience of staying idle at home while our colleagues in other schools are in school. We have all learnt that we should make our grievances known to the appropriate authority without taking laws into our hands. <br>\n      I would be grateful if you could favorably consider my plea for the re-opening of the school. <br>\n                                                                                                                                     Yours faithfully, <br>\n                                                                                                                                     (Signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                     Akinade Abosede </p>",

        "question": "<p>As your contribution to a debate, write arguments for or against the proposition. \"We are happier than our fore fathers\".</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                   WE ARE HAPPIER THAN OUR FORE - FATHERS <br>\n      Good day, Mr. Chairman, panel of Judges, co-debaters, ladies and gentlemen. I am standing before you to support the proposition that \"we are happier than our fore-fathers\". <br>\n      Our fore-fathers belong to the old times when life was brutish and old-fashioned. Definitely, we are happier than they f because our fore-fathers lived hard and uninteresting lives, in most cases, in their caves. They were not liberated even in their though s and they passed through this world in severe hardship. They didn't enjoy modern, fascinating and comfortable life that we are enjoying today. <br>\n      My attentive audience, you will agree with me that education is light. If education is light and our fore-fathers were not educated then we can say that they lived in darkness. Since our fore-fathers lacked education, they could not invent anything or gadget that could make their existence worthwhile. They lived a life that was dull and drab, devoid of the interesting inventions of our time. They could not read or write hence, they could not put down history nor invent gadgets that could esult of l make uman nce pleasurable. This made the days of our fore-father difficult. <br>\n      As a result of lack of education, our fore-fathers could not practise mechanised farming. Though they found pleasure in farming as occupation, they practised farming with difficulty. They used the traditional tools like cutlass and hoes which made farming during their time a drudgery rather than an occupation. At their homes, there were no household gadgets like refrigerator. blender, gas-cooker and other \"mechanical slaves\" that can make household chores like cooking interesting. <br>\n      Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to imagine life without adequate means of movement from one place to the other. The only means of transportation then was foot. They trekked long distances but nowadays we have the various means of transportation. We have vehicles, airplanes and ocean vessels at our disposal. Furthermore, nowadays we do not need to embark on wasted journeys or unnecessary ones as we can communicate with every part of the world through telephone and fax machines. These modern methods of communication and transportation were not available during the days of our fore-fathers. In fact, we live in a global village where there are constant and uninterrupted connections and relationships among people of diverse culture and tradition. This makes us happier than our fore-fathers since there is truth in the saying the more, the merrier\". <br>\n      I know that my opponent will want to argue that our fore-fathers lived longer than we do nowadays, but tell me what the benefit of long life is when it is not lived in comfort. Definitely, it is not how long we live but how well. Though we may have shorter life span than our fore-fathers. we are happier than they because we have many modern things at our disposal. We have good health facilities, sound knowledge of hygiene and modem equipment which make living worthwhile and interesting I hope that with these few points of mine. I have been able to convince you that we are happier than our fore-fathers. Thank you. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                                              WHERE THERE IS A WILL, THERE IS A WAY <br>\n      I have not been able to understand the joy that my filled my heart and the wonderful things that have been happening in my life. I now recall as I always do. the last words of my father there he gave up the ghost. I can remember vividly that he said \"nothing is impossible under the sun and as long as there is a will, there is always a way\". Moreso, I tried to recollect again the incidents that followed the death of my father. <br>\n      I had just finished my Senior Secondary School promotion examination and I was going home when I noticed that my someone was running towards me She was shouting my name and informing me that something had happened at home This person who happened to be my aunty. kept on repeating her words. I  was confused as I could not believe that my father was probably dead though he had been ill for some weeks. Then my aunty finally broke the news: \"Olu, father is dead\" I broke down in tears and that was how my trouble began.<br>\n      My mother died when giving birth to me. her first and only child. Ever since then, it had always been my father and I Now my father was gone. Who was going to cater for my up-bringing? My father's only sister was poor and she had little means for catering for her little children and herself. She also depended on my father. I then realised that I was in the world alone.<br>\n      I applied as a houseboy in one of my neighbour's houses and out of pity, I was hired. My master took the responsibility of sending me to school I was very pleased and I always tried my best to please him. I also did all the best I could to do well in school so as to encourage my master. Since he had no child, he treated me almost like his own. The only difference was that I called him \"Oga\" and not \"father\". I counted myself lucky. <br>\n      I then took my final examinations and came out with the best result in my school. Soon after this, my master sent me packing and I felt as if I was born with a curse on my head He told me that he would not be able to pay for my education neither would he be able to accommodate me any more. And then. it was like all hope was lost and I decided to look for a menial job.<br>\n      I took up a job as a cleaner in a small company in my village and after working for three months, all I could still afford were three square meals \"Was this how I was going to continue?,\" I asked myself. While I was considering my depressing condition the words of my late father came back to me. This raised my enthusiasm and hope and there and then, I decided I must further my education. I then began to save some money to buy Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB)form. <br>\n      After about a year of saving money. I purchased the form and wrote the examination and I came out in such flying colours that my community offered me a scholarship to study Accountancy in the university. With determination, I came out of the university with a first class degree in Accountancy. The following year after graduation, I became a Chartered Accountant. <br>\n      Now I am a respectable Accountant in the society and I still owe my success to the saying of my late father that \"where there is a will, there is a way.\"</p>",

Each time he wrote a letter for my illiterate father, he merely ran his tongue over the inner edge of the flap of the envelope, folded it and then sealed it. Just like that! In my puzzlement, I tried the same trick repeatedly with two pieces of paper but my saliva failed to hold them together. I then theorized that my cousin's saliva must be gummy. If that was so, why wasn't mine? My studied search for a solution led to the very sound conclusion that my cousin's saliva was gummy because he was the only educated man in the family. By extension. I reasoned that all educated people had sticky saliva.</p><p>      But it didn't take me long to wonder why my cousin's lower jaw was not stuck to the upper jaw. Indeed.

But, to my amazement, the flap would not stick well to the body of the envelope, no matter how many times she applied her saliva. In the end, father used some pap as gum.

For example, one often hears that school A is better than B in Mathematics and Science while the latter is better than the former in English Language and the Liberal Arts. Whatever the focus of these comparative statements, there remains the fact that schools do vary in terms of average student achievement.</p><p>      Why is it then that some schools have high average student achievement while others have low average student achievement? The reasons are not far-fetched. The first reason is that some schools are located in privileged areas in the sense that the students come from homes where parents care about their children's education ensure that the children are well-fed, show interest in their school work and provide easy access to books in the home. On the other hand, there are schools which serve less privileged communities, and whose students come from homes where parents are unable to provide the necessary support services for good academic work. Students in the first type of school would generally have a higher rate of achievement than those in the second type.</p><p>      Another reason for the difference in academic achievement between schools is how well the schools are equipped. Schools that have good laboratories and libraries, ample space. places to sit and write for every student and optimum-sized classrooms usually record a higher standard of student achievement than those where the basic equipment is lacking or where the students are crammed into inadequate spaces.</p><p>      The quality of the teachers also has to do with the differences in student achievement between schools. A teacher that does not have a good grasp of his subject matter nor is committed to his job cannot produce an outstanding student. On the other hand students will generally attain a high standard where the teacher is an expert in his field, knows how to structure the material to be learned, demands a lot from his students and motivates them. Also, school management has been found to have a relationship with student achievement. Students perform better in schools where the leadership is enthusiastic and creative than in schools where the principals and teachers adopt a casual attitude to their job.</p><p>      Finally, discipline cannot be divorced from the learning process, and this is often seen from the perspective of general student behaviour. Where students show a disregard for the rules and regulations that guide good learning by disobeying their teachers, neglecting their homework or playing truant, they cannot make any reasonable academic progress. On the other hand, students who comport themselves well have laid a good foundation for academic success.</p><p>(a) In one sentence, summarize the yardsticks used to make a distinction between one school and another.</p><p>(b) In five sentences, one for each. summarize the factors responsible for the different levels of achievement in schools.</p>",
