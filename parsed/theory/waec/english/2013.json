I would be unhappy if you transfer me to another school, when I am about to complete my education in the school. The reason why y I would like to remain in m school is not far fetched, I am sure that you would have noticed the great improvement in my results in the last one year This is also true of results of other students in the school. The school has definitely improved tremendously in academic performance. The school's results in WASSCE and NECO Senior School Certificate Examination in the last three years have improved. In fact, the school recorded 98% performance in the last Senior School Certificate Examination with many students having distinctions in English Language and Mathematics. Daddy, 1 know that you wouldn't expect me to leave a highly performing school for another school that I am not sure of itsperformance in public examinations.</p><p>      Secondly, my present school has a crop of qualified teachers. Teachers in my school are all graduates with several years of teaching experience with most of them experienced examiners of public examinations. They are specialists in their various specialization. Apart from this, all the teachers are very friendly and committed to the academic improvement of their students. They are approachable as they are always ready to explain difficult topics to us when we approach them for further explanations.</p><p>      Apart from this, effective teaching and learning are going on in my school as a result of the conducive learning in the school. This is made possible by the presence of effective infrastructures in the school. Our classrooms are spacious and well-ventilated with students adequately equipped with necessary academic infrastructures. The school is not over-populated with all the students well-seated in classrooms.</p><p>      Daddy, as a science student, I wouldn't want to leave my present school with well-equipped laboratories for a school which is poorly-equipped. Our science laboratories are adequately equipped with all scientific apparatus that we always use for practicals. This is the main reasons why my present school always excel in science competitions in the state.</p><p>      Lastly. daddy, you can't be sure of the academic performance of the school you intend to transfer me to. Therefore, it is better for me to stay in my present school where I am sure that I am going to pass the Senior School Certificate Examination with flying colours.</p><p>      How are you and your work? I hope that you are fine. My regards to Mummy. Grace and Jide.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                                     Yours sincerely.</p><p>                                                                                                                                      Felicia</p>",

        "question": "<p> Write an article for publication in a national newspaper on the importance of education in national development.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.</p><p>      The fact that education is imperative to national development cannot be over-emphasized. No nation can develop without education In fact, education always engineers development of nations. Industrialized or developed countries of the world like Japan. the United States of America and Britain achieved rapid development because of their exposure to education, especially scientific education</p><p>      Modern days inventions especially in the area of technology can not be achieved without education. Technological inventions like aeroplanes, ships, electricity and numerous electronic gadgets that make lives easy for people in the world today could not be accomplished without education. These inventions are nothing but scientific accomplishments which are engendered by scientific researchers. These inventions contribute in no small measure to the development of nations where they are made.</p><p>      Apart from this, improvements in the area of medicine and communication come about as a result of education. Nowadays, it is easy to communicate with people across the world. The world is now a global village with the invention of various communication gadgets and the internet. The use of social media could not have been possible without education. The invention of these communication gadgets like mobile phones and the internet makes it easy for the nations that invent them to earn enormous foreign exchange which is used for the development of such nations. The invention of computers through educational research enables countries with such inventions to sell than to developing nations of the world to earn foreign exchange. The resources obtained from the wealth made are used for national development. In the same ways, developing nations buy vaccines to communication and other purposes from nations that produce them thereby developing such nations through wealth generated from such sale.</p><p>      In fact, achievements recorded in any nation can not be separated from educational development of such nation. This is the reason why any nation which wishes to develop must adequately structure and fund the education of its people. Tremendous improvement in agriculture could not have been possible without education. Education has been able to move agriculture from its primitive stage to modernity. The contribution of modern facilities like tractors, harvesters, mowers to agriculture could not have been possible without technological education. To say the obvious, these agricultural apparatus are invention of technology which is the result of education. Countries which invent these modern agricultural tools sell them to developing nations and through this. they earn wealth which is used for national developments. Apart, from this these countries are able to feed their citizens.</p><p>      Undoubtedly. education is important to national development as nations which neglect the education of their citizens can never witness both economic and social development. Technology development that bring about national development cannot be accomplished in countries where people are wallowing in ignorance.</p><p>                                                                                                                                     Helen Enyia.</p><p>                                                                                                                                     SS2A2.</p>",

Therefore, I am writing to complain about this and to explain ways in which this situation can be remedied.</p><p>      Sir, it is obvious that the quality of food served in our canteens in the school is poor and unhealthy. As students, we have made our complaints known to the food sellers in the school several times through the food prefect but nothing is done about it. We even went further to make our grievances about the poor quality of food served to the Chairman of the school's food committee yet there is no improvement. The Chairman only promised to tell the food vendors about our complaint but we do not see any improvement in the quality of food served.</p><p>      The situation is growing worse by the day as the food vendors continue to serve poor quality food. In fact, many students fall sick after eating food served in the school. The fruits sold to students are not better as they are sometimes unripe and bad. Last week, a student complained of stomachache after eating the food sold in one of our canteens. The student had to be rushed to a hospital for quick treatment. This is one example as many other students have suffered from one illness or the other as a result of the poor quality of food served in the school. Obviously, the students are fed up with this situation and I am sure that if something is not done about it, the school may witness a riot or a mass protest which may damage the reputation of the school.</p><p>      The situation needs to be remedied as quickly as possible. Firstly, the school's food committee should be reconstituted with new members who are committed to students' welfare. It seems as if members of the present food committee have failed to bring about a change needed to ensure that quality food are served in the school.</p><p>      Secondly, food vendors should be made to give samples of their food to members of the food committee to examine everyday before students are made to buy food from them. If their food is found to be of poor quality, they should be empowered to seize such food.</p><p>      Apart from this, teachers should be made to buy food from the school's vendors. This will make the teachers to ascertain the quality of food sold to students. Presently teachers don't patronize the school's vendors as they go outside the school to buy food. This does not allow them to experience what the students are experiencing. Sir, I believe that if you take these steps, the situations will be remedied and students will be able to have a new lease of life.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                                       Yours faithfully,</p><p>                                                                                                                                       Signature</p><p>                                                                                                                                       Boadley Folarin.</p>",

        "question": "<p>You are the Chief Speaker in a debate on the topic: Education is not as important as riches. Write your argument for or against the topic.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>      Chairman, Panel of Judges, Co-debaters, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here to speak against the motion which states that education is not as important as riches. Education is a process of acquiring learning and knowledge which equips an individual for the challenges of life. It makes an individual to be adequately fit into the society in which he finds himself. Education as against ignorance, brings out the best in every individual. Riches, on the other hand, has to do with acquiring wealth and opulence which may be difficult to maintain without adequate knowledge.</p><p>      There is a common saying that if education is expensive, try ignorance. This is true as education has to do with acquiring knowledge with which riches can be adequately administered and controlled. What is riches without education? It is useless and unworthy without education. A rich man without education will definitely discover that something i substantial and great is missing in his life. He feels the yawning gap n his life. He may have the money to throw around but he may fritter away his money if he lacks good education to administer his wealth. He may hire educated people to assist him in the company or business he establishes but the fact is that he lacks the knowledge to adequately control his enormous wealth. He has to depend on educated people around him for the successful administration of his wealth.</p><p>      Apart from this, an uneducated rich person is already restricted and limited in the society. His experience is not complete if he has not attended any school as there is giving to be a yawning gap between him and those who are educated. He cannot be trusted with positions where education is a Prerequisite. He cannot aspire to become a governor of a state or the president of a country.</p><p>      Education has the capacity to transform   from being ignorant to being informed. Riches, no matter how enormous it is, cannot do this. It is a mind opener as it makes a person not to be narrow-minded. Education is a liberator of the mind in a way that riches deformed mind. Riches can't do this;  cannot be. An informed person is already liberated and he cannot have a person to be self-assuming. s, it can only make a person to be arrogant and proud because wealth can make a person self-assuming.</p><p>      Definitely, education is the most important factor in determining a successful life. Even education is essential in one's life and it could be a pathway to riches. Chairman, Panels of Judges, I hope that with these few points of mine, I have been able to convince you that education is as important as riches.</p>",

        "question": "<p>Write a story ending with the statement: Indeed, it was the biggest lesson of my life.</p>",
        "answer": "<p> I wouldn't say that the bitter lesson from the that happened in my life was part of my destiny. In fact, I couldn't but remember this particular incident that later came to shape my life adversely. However hard I tried to forget the incident, its ugly memory always come to hunt me.</p><p>      I was the third child of a family of four where our lives were regulated by religious doctrines. My father was a clergyman, so we, his children were brought up in a strict and regimented home where things that could be tolerated by other families were forbidden. I grew up as a child in this family until I gained admission into a mission school in a neighbouring city and I had to leave home for a boarding secondary school. I had to live in a hostel and so for the first time, I had the opportunity of mixing with girls from various homes as my school was a girls' school.</p><p>      I still remembered the warning of my mother when she was about to leave me after assisting me in carrying my load into my hostel. Shade, you must not forget the home you came from. You must not disappoint your father and me. Be guided by all the religions teachings you have been taught both at home and in the church.\" After saying these words, my mother with tears cascading down her cheeks, reluctantly entered into the car that brought me and the driver drove off.</p><p>      The warning of my mother echoed in my ear until I fell into the trap set for me by my friends, Susan and Jennifer. Before this time, I was highly regarded by my teachers and mates as a girl who would never want to come near anything that could tarnish her image. Most times, I kept to myself so as to avoid ugly incidences that could make me disappoint my parents. While some of my mates engaged in social activities like sneaking out of school to attend parties, I shunned such things.</p><p>      This good reputation of mine was one day tarnished by the bitter experience I had. One open day when we were permitted, as boarders, to visit town. Jennifer and Susan prevailed on me to accompany them to town on a visit to Jennifer's uncle who had just arrived the country from Britain. Jennifer was a native of the city but lived in the same hostel with me in school When we got to Jennifer's house. we were welcomed by three boys whom Jennifer said were her cousins. While we were waiting for Jennifer's uncle who we were told was resting upstairs, we were served drinks. This is what I could remembered until the second day when I woke up to find myself on a hospital bed in a hospital in the town. Unknown to me. Susan and Jennifer must have conspired with Jennifer's cousin to lace my drinks I was served with alcohol and sleeping pills so as to make it easy for me to be raped by her cousins. As I was told, I was indeed raped.</p><p>      The incident later became a scandal in my school and I was expelled in my final year. As if this was not enough, three months later, my parents discovered that I was pregnant. This incident traumatized my parent and I was disowned by my father. I had to flee to my uncle's house to have the baby.  </p><p>      The reality of this ugly incident now dawn on me. Saddled with a grown-up boy, no man is ready to marry me and my father died three years ago without forgiving me just I also find it difficult to forgive Susan and Jennifer despite their efforts to seek my forgiveness. I now go about with a heavy conscience with the fear that this may ruin my Christian life. But I learn a lesson that it is not good to trust anyone. I had to learn that lesson in a very hard way. Indeed, it was the biggest lesson of my life.</p>",

He did not look very likeable nor did he appear to be an achiever. Nothing was spectacular about him apart from the fact that he was a South African. Most of us who knew the goings-on in his country regarded him as one of the luckless refugees from the apartheid regime. After the mild clapping, we forgot about the man with giant, hungry looks.</p><p>      During his first lesson in our class, it struck me that not once did he consult the textbook. Rather, to teach the properties of the square and rectangle, he made us measure the top of our tables, the classroom doors, and other objects around. From there, we discovered that these objects had opposite equal sides, and all the angles were equal. We did not have to learn these from books; he made us find out. When later I consulted my textbook, what Durell, the great mathematician, wrote came every much alive. I started to see Mr. Njobe as equal to Durrell.</p><p>      With time, we began to like his teaching. He taught with zeal and usually through playlike methods. His class was always lively and full of jokes. For instance, to each us the properties of a circle, he instructed us to bring out the bowls which we used for the midday meal. During the lesson, he made each one measure the distance round his bowl. Incidentally, almost every bowl was different in size. We laughed at the sizes of the different bowls while we measured them. Throughout the lesson, there was much laughter. Finally, he told each student to divide the distance round the bowl by the distance through the centre. Imagine our amazement when we discovered that, whatever the size of the bowl, all the answers were the same. This he explained is the base in all computations regarding the circle. That was fifty years ago and I have not forgotten. He actually tamed Mathematics for us, terrifying as it was.</p><p>      Then, one day, we learnt that Mr. Njobe was on admission in Wesley Guild Hospital. Our representatives sent to convey our good wishes were refused entry into the intensive care unit: they were told that his condition was critical. We virtually went into mourning for weeks.
