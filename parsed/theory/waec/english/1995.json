        "question": "<p>Your younger sister in SSII has written for your advice on what subjects she should study for the SSCE. As someone who knows her ability in the different subjects, write a letter to her giving advice on why she should choose certain subjects rather than others.

        "answer": "<p>                                                                                                                                    3 Yemi Alakija Street <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Okeira, Ogba <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Lagos. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    30th August, 1995.</p><p>Dear Kemi, </p><p><br>\n      I thank you for your letter dated 20th July. The content of the letter was well understood. I was very happy when I read that you wanted me to give you advice on the subjects to study for the SSCE. <br>\n      I sincerely appreciate it that you realised so soon that it is good to request for advice on the subjects to offer. With your performance in your last promotion examination, I would like you to offer Arts subjects. I noticed that you are good at Arts. i Your grades in English Language, Literature in English, Christian Religious Knowledge, Yoruba and Economics are very impressive. Going through your past report cards since you started secondary school, one can very easily conclude that you are good at Arts subjects. Commercial subjects are your second best, but you are not good at Commercial subjects like Accounts, Commerce and other related subjects like Mathematics and Geography. Since you are not good at these subjects, I won't advise you to offer them.<br>\n      Moreso, I won't advise you to study science subjects because of your deficiency in calculations. It is not possible to make a headway in the sciences without being good at Mathematics. Therefore, I would advise you to offer subjects that would enable you to study Law or Mass Communication in future. I know that you are going to fit into these two professions because you are good in Arts subjects and also you are the outspoken type. I can remember vividly that you told me that you won many prizes in debating competitions in which you represented your school. I know also that you have a flair for writing. I can see this clearly in your letters to me and whenever I have the chance to argue with you on topical national issues, I always see the polemical skill in you and the aggressiveness with which you logically put forward your points, even if they are not correct. <br>\n      In view of my observation of your potentials, I would advise you to go for the legal profession. As a lawyer, you'll be a pride to our family. The following subjects are suitable for you: English Language, Literature in English, Government, C. R. K, Mathematics, Commerce, Fine Arts and Biology. Conclusively, Kemi. try as much as possible to make use of this piece of advice. You must study very hard so as to come out in flying colours in your SSCE. </p><p>                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely, <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Kunle.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>                                THE OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA IN OKEIRA. <br>\n      The recent outbreak of cholera in Okeira claimed several lives. It started like a small outbreak of infection which could be contained but it later took a frightening proportion leading to an epidemic. The epidemic lasted for two days but its effects are massive. <br>\n      The cholera outbreak was caused by the unhealthy environment which is as a result of the unhygienic nature of the residents of Okeira. Almost everywhere, you will find heaps of refuse. Refuse bins are not readily emptied and every roadside is littered with the waste. It is a common sight to see mountainous dunghills covering up the major roads in the community. Furthermore, Okeira lacks good drinkable water. The residents depend on a stream where the whole community gets its water. The stream itself is not hygienic and clean enough for drinking as different people enter it to bath and fetch from the same source. Some of these people have sore on their legs and other forms of infections Defecation around the stream does not help matters as this stream becomes contaminated with virus and germs. <br>\n      Similarly, Okeira lacks a good market where people can buy food items. The local market is located at the far end of the community which makes it difficult for people to trek down to buy things there. The residents, therefore, have to buy food items from hawkers who expose their goods to flies. Meat sellers go about without covering their wares. <br>\n      The effects of the epidemic are colossal. Many lives are lost. According to the available medical report, about two hundred and fifty people died in two days as a result of the epidemic. Many able-bodied men, women and children lost their lives, thus causing anguish and sorrow in the community. <br>\n      The state government and the Ikeja Local Government Council should come to the rescue of the residents of Okeira. My suggestion is that the government should launch a campaign to enlighten the residents on how to cultivate simple hygienic habits. Secondly, the Local government should ensure that the heaps of refuse are cleared on time. Thirdly, sanitary inspectors should be sent out to inspect homes in the community and ensure that the residents clean their surroundings regularly. Any resident who fails to maintain a clean environment should be made to pay a fine as punishment. Lastly, government hospitals should be built for the residents and the clinic in the community should be equipped to contain further outbreaks of such epidemic. </p><p>                                                                                                                                    Caleb Farayola, <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Okeira</p>",

        "question": "<p>The topic of a debate organized by the Directorate for Mass Mobilization for senior secondary schools is: The open ballot system is better than the secret ballot system for Nigeria. Write your contribution for or against the motion.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>              OPEN BALLOT SYSTEM IS NOT BETTER THAN SECRET BALLOT SYSTEM <br>\n      Good afternoon, chairman, moderator, panel of Judges, accurate time-keeper, co-debaters, ladies and gentlemen. I am standing before you to oppose the motion which states that the open ballot system is better than the secret ballot systern. The open ballot system option is a system of voting which requires that voters should vote openly by queuing behind their candidate while the secret ballot system, on the other hand, demands that a voter secretly exercises his or her voting right inside a polling booth. <br>\n      As far as I am concerned, the best voting option for Nigeria is the secret ballot system. The politics of Nigeria is very volatile and every attempt to use the open secret ballot system has been accompanied by violence and political bickerings. In the past, there have been cases of violent attack on the voters who refused to line up behind certain candidates. The secret ballot system protects every voter from all forms of attack. It gives room for a voter to confidently and secretly exercise his or her right without any fear of molestation. Our political development has not got to the level of using the open ballot system. <br>\n      Furthermore, it is easy for voters to use their discretion in voting for a candidate. in a secret ballot system, a voter votes objectively according to his or her assessment of the potentials of a prospective contestant. <br>\n      In addition to this, it thwarts the attempt of politicians to buy voters over with money. Therefore, it discourages the use of money to hijack elections by \"money bags\". As we all know. Nigerian politicians are fond of throwing money about when elections are approaching with the desire to influence the electorate unduly. The secret ballot system discourages this as many politicians have realised that the electorate can just collect their money without voting for them. <br>\n      Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I know my opponents want to claim that the open ballot system makes it convenient for easy counting and to reduce the rate of rigging, but what of the latent coercion and intimidation which make objective voting impossible? Even the secret ballot system makes it easy for a re-counting when there is a legal dispute about the election of a winner. It is very easy to re-count the ballot papers in a court of law. <br>\n      Finally, the secret ballot system makes it possible for every citizen above the age of eighteen to come out to vote. Those who dislike queuing up definitely find it easy to vote secretly. Most of the electorates prefer the secret ballot system because it saves them from embarrassment and molestation. <br>\n      Panel of Judges and my attentive audience, I strongly believe that I have been able to convince you that the secret ballot system is better for Nigeria than the open ballot system. Thank you. <br>\n </p>",

The fact is that Akin refused to obey the senior. After siesta. on the second day, senior Ayansola, with other senior students, asked the junior student to kneel down. Though he obeyed. he knelt down grudgingly. He was later released after kneeling down throughout the games period that day. Aside from kneeling down the junior student was instructed to fetch four buckets of water for senior Ayansola the following morning. <br>\n      The boy refused to obey the instruction as Senior Ayansola waited in vain for him. When senior Ayansola met the disobedient Akin in the school on the day of the incident, he asked him to report for punishment after the school hours. In fact, he refused to obey again and this made Senior Ayansola s classmates to determine to deal squarely with him. <br>\n      In the afternoon, as usual after siesta, the junior student was called and when he was asked to kneel down, he disobeyed. It was his flagrant disobedience that made the senior students to beat him with their belts. It was during the flogging that the buckle of one of the belts hit him on his right eye. <br>\n      Sir, this was what actually happened.

The dark clouds covered the whole sky within few minutes. This was followed by a heavy wind which blew like a cyclone in a hot arid land. Residents rushed into their houses and in a hot afternoon, people felt the darkness to the extent that they thought it was night. The wind was followed by heavy rain which lasted for several hours. <br>\n      The damage caused by the rainstorm was colossal. Many houses got their roofs blown off, electric poles were uprooted, many other houses collapsed while majority of the houses were flooded. Those who could pack their property to safe places did so,while those who were not at home when the rain started met their belongings floating on the water and their houses inaccessible. There was a case of a young man who lost his life while holding on to a door near the electric metre of his house, in an attempt to put the metre off. In fact, properties worth millions of naira were lost in the rainstorm. <br>\n      Many people also lost their lives while many were rendered homeless.

        "answer": "<p>.                             THE SHAME THAT REFUSES TO GO <br>\n      When I was fourteen years old, I was sent from my village to live with my sister who had just got married. My sister had complained about the need to have a house help after having her first born. With the permission of my parents, I went to live with my sister and her husband in Lagos. <br>\n      Immediately I got to Lagos, I was registered in a school very near our house. My sister was a business woman who sold ladies shoes and bags while her husband was a civil servant. My sister regularly traveled to the eastern part of the country to buy her wares. In most times, I would be alone in the house with her husband and their baby. <br>\n      After living with them for four years, I noticed a change in the attitude of my sister's husband towards me. He was unnecessarily lavishing his care on me; buying me dresses and gifts. Several times, he bought new clothes for me and whenever he did this, he would instruct me not to tell my sister. <br>\n      One day, while my sister was away to Onitsha on a business trip, her husband called me and instructed me to cook rice and 'dodo' in the evening and that I should not go to bed until he came back at night. I did as he instructed me and I struggled to stay awake until he came back around 10:30pm. <br>\n      When he came back, he asked me to serve the rice and 'dodo' in one plate and that we were going to eat together. I told him that I had eaten but he insisted that I would eat with him on the same table. He further told me that. he loved me and that all the beautiful dresses and gifts he had bought for me were mine if I would allow him to make love to me. My excuse that he should realise that he was my sister's husband fell on deaf ears. <br>\n      To cut a long story short, we made love that night and that was the beginning of the several love bouts we had. After a year of having this secret love affair with my sister's husband, I got pregnant. When I told him that I was pregnant for him, he told me to make it a secret forever if I could not agree to abort it. <br>\n      I was afraid to commit abortion and it did not take long before I was found out by my sister. She forced me to tell her who was responsible for my pregnancy. In her annoyance, she sent me back to my parents in the village, divorced her husband and swore to renounce me as her sister. <br>\n      I later got married and I had to live with my first child whom I had for my sister's husband, in my husband's house. My husband did not know that Ade was my first child until somebody told him the whole story of my life. He lost all confidence in me and since then things have not been the way it used to be He couldn't love me as he used to and so I have had to live with this stigma for the rest of my life. </p>",

Informed by his niece that there was a bucket of water for him in the bath, he hurried down there, half-dressed, holding a towel. The bathroom. located by the side of the building, was an improvised rectangular enclosure made of palm fronds. Hissing to himself. he went in and used his clothes and large towel to cover some openings in the enclosure. He started bathing. Then it happened. With every inch of his body <ins>thoroughly </ins>covered with soap lather, hardly able to open his eyes, he heard someone removing his clothes and towel.

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it</p><p>. <br>\n      The history of warfare reveals that man has come a long way. In the beginning man contented him self with simple hand-hurled missiles. Man threw the stone at other animals and. in warfare, at his enemies. Destruction was minimal, as this was determined by the size and roughness of the stone and the energy of the thrower. Even when man later invented the catapult, destruction was only slightly higher. The primitive catapult was made out of a tough rope at one end of which was tied a big stone. Its most limiting factor was that such a missile, no matter how strong the force behind it, could kill only one person at a time. <br>\n      Things were relatively easier for the assailant with the invention of the bow and arrow. For the first time, man utilized very little strength to bring down his enemy, even at a fairly distant position. The size of the bow, the elasticity of its string, and the sharpness of the arrow, much more than the crude energy of the thrower, determined how far and fast the arrow traveled. The weapon became even more significant when man later learnt to fix a sharp metal to the tip of the arrow. And when that metal was dyed in highly lethal poison, it became even more effective in killing a man. <br>\n      With the coming of metal, farm implements were developed. But man soon turned some of these, especially the machete. into weapons of combat. The sword is thus a very close cousin of the machete. Used in combat, the sword, especially when carried by a very skillful fighter on a horse, could wreak far more havoc than the bow and arrow. It is hence understandable that the foremost conquerors of the classical period, from Alexander the Great to Julius Caesar, used this simple hand-borne instrument of combat. And this, in its simple turn with the invention of the gun and the bullet. The arrival of the gun introduced destruction of human lives at an unprecedented rate with even the most elementary gun. In the hands of foot soldiers, it became possible to count casualties in hundreds in a single encounter. With practically no physical effort, apart from the moving of a finger on the trigger, the highly lethal bullet is sent through the barrel at a speed much faster than that of sound. The enemy, at a considerable distance, may thus be brought down without even hearing the sound of the shooting or seeing his assailant.</p><p>      The development of grenades, bombs, missiles, nuclear and chemical war-heads have made all previous weapons appear little more than toys. With bombs delivered by fast-flying airplanes, and nuclear or chemical war-heads borne to their distant destinations by unnamed missiles, destruction of cities and, in fact, of whole countries within a matter of hours is now a great possibility. Today, man doesn't need to be physically present to haul the stone, or throw the spear, or send the arrow. The missile has now replaced all these, and it does not need to be physically sent by an individual. Electronics and computers do the launching, and men die in hundreds of thousands.</p><p>In six sentences, one for each, summarize the six different types of weapons of warfare and their relative effectiveness.</p>",
