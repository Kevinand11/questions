        "question": "<p>You are the chief speaker in a debate on the topic: 'Female children are more beneficial than male children to their parents'. Write out your speech for or against the motion.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                         MALE CHILDREN ARE MORE BENEFICIAL TO THEIR PARENTS THAN FEMALE CHILDREN. <br>\n      Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Panel of Judges, accurate time-keeper, co-debaters, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am Mojeed Odeduntan representing SSS Ii. I am here to oppose strongly the motion which states that \"female children are more beneficial to their parents than male children.\"<br>\n      Of course, the matter does not require much argument. It is a widely known fact that male children are more beneficial to their parents than female. Male children are stronger than their female counterparts. As a result of this they work harder than female children. Arduous and strenuous house chores are reserved for male children. I know my opponents will want to tell us that female children are more useful in the kitchen, but I want to tell you that male children are also useful in the kitchen. It depends on how their parents train them. Some people also argue that what a male child can do, a female child can do better. Tell me, isn't that a stupid argument? I want to ask them this question. Can a female child be asked to use an axe to split firewood in a situation where the parents have to cook food and there is no gas or kerosine? This type of strenuous work is reserved for male children.<br>\n      Secondly, female children are very expensive to maintain in the family. Give a male child two pairs of trousers and three shirts, and he is satisfied. Female children always ask for many irrelevant things from their parents, and before long, they will demand a big wardrobe before they can go to school. Female children are expensive to maintain. <br>\n      Thirdly, female children usually don't retain their maiden name immediately they get married. Since a wife will always be under the control of her husband, she has no choice than to change her maiden name to that of her husband. Of course, a male child keeps and maintains his family's name till death. <br>\n      In many parts of the country till today, male children are regarded as the pillar of their family. A male child takes over from his father after his death. He controls the affairs of his father's family and preserves the good name and reputation of his parents. In contrast, a female child gets married and faces the affairs of her husband's family. <br>\n      Lastly, I disagree with the argument that female children take care of their parents in old age. This is not true in its entirety. Male children take control of their father's household and as a result of this, they are close to their parents, even when they are old. They know their needs on first hand basis, and they take prompt care of their aged parents. <br>\n      Mr Chairman, Panel of Judges and my audience, I believe that with these few points of mine. I have been able to convince you that male children are more beneficial to their parents than the female children. <br>\n </p>",

There is no doubt that our sports contingents have gone, competed and conquered. Our football squad brought Atlanta. the venue of the 1996 Olympic Games. to a standstill when they defeated Argentina and Brazil to win the gold medal. For the first time in the history of the Olympic games, Nigeria won the highest number of gold, bronze and silver medals. <br>\n      Success, especially in games, does not come by chance. There is no doubt that there are some factors which are responsible for the success of our sportsmen and women. The first factor is that our sportsmen and women were camped in time. This afforded them the opportunity to blend which enhanced their pattern of play in Atlanta. The foreign based players came right on time to camp and they blended easily with those who were home based. <br>\n      The second factor is the availability of good sporting facilities in our stadia. It seems the Federal Government was determined, this time around, to give sports priority. Our stadia were equipped with training facilities and funds were made available for the sportsmen and women and the coaches to travel around the world for trial matches prior to the games. This made the level of their preparation very high. This was coupled with the strong determination of our contingent to excel. <br>\n      The Nigerian government has a lot of lesson to learn from our victory. The key to success in anything we are doing is sound preparation. It should be encouraged and it should be made a national policy. <br>\n      In addition to this, we have learnt that in spite of the seeming invincibility of the hitherto world soccer giants like Argentina and Brazil, there is no country that cannot win the world cup. It all depends on the level of preparation and determination. </p><p>                                                                                                                                    Yours faithfully, <br>\n                                                                                                                                    (signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Orialiku Peters. </p>",

        "question": "<p>A foreign magazine has requested articles on some traditional ceremonies of your people. Write your contribution describing any one ceremony such as marriage, funeral or child-naming.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                    CHILD NAMING CEREMONY AMONG THE YORUBAS. <br>\n      The arrival of a new baby into a family among the Yorubas is usually greeted with joy. The reason is that the Yoruba people believe that the family which has the new baby is expanding and prosperous. They regard the gift of a child from Oduduwa, their progenitor, as a mark of the fact that the family is not forgotten by its forefathers.<br>\n      Immediately a child is born, a message is sent to all the relations who are around in the village or town and to those who have gone to farm to come home for the naming ceremony of the baby. The naming ceremony for a male child f usually comes up on the ninth day after his birth while a female child is usually named on the eight day. The reason for this is that the Yoruba people believe that a man has nine bones while a woman has eight. So, those relations at home and those in the farm know the day a new baby will be named due to the sex of the new born baby. <br>\n      On the day of the naming ceremony, the entire family will come together at the house of the \"Olori-ebi\", the head of the family, usually the eldest male member of the family. He is the one to preside over and direct the ceremony since everything usually takes place in his house. The reason is that among the Yoruba people, the family idol and shrine is located in the compound of the \"olori-ebi\". Before the naming ceremony commences, the baby must have been bathed very early in the morning by the wives of the members of the family. The baby is carried to the house of the head of the wives of the family who is usually the oldest among the wives. She is to carry the baby to the house of the head of the family for the ceremony and while the ceremony lasts, she is the one to carry the baby before handing him over to his mother after the ceremony. <br>\n      During the naming ceremony, a lot of prayers are offered for the new baby using the following items: 'orogbo' (bitter cola), sugar, honey, sugar-cane and palm-oil. These items must be presented by the father of the baby and they are used in praying for the baby. The items are taken one after the other with a little bit of each put in the mouth of the baby while the people attending the ceremony eat the rest, with parts remaining to be offered at the family shrine. <br>\n      The naming ceremony is not completed without taking the baby to the family shrine. The baby is given to the head of the family who is also the custodian of the family shrine for the remaining part of the ceremony. He would carry the baby to the shrine, offer him to the idol for guidance throughout his life and use the remaining items to appease the god and offer prayers. If the baby comes from the family of those with traditional tribal marks, he is branded with his family's tribal mark. <br>\n      After this, the baby is then handed over to the eldest wife of the family amidst singing and dancing. At the end of the ceremony, the child is handed over to his mother. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Bunmi Omokija, <br>\n                                                                                                                                    SS 3B. </p>",

I hope that you are trying to settle down with your studies after the long vacation. I have not been able to be myself since the quarrel which led to the break in our relationship. In fact, I still cannot believe that the little misunderstanding caused by backbiters, who call themselves our friends could escalate to such proportion. It is, indeed, a pity that we allowed those who pretended to be our friends to bring us on a war path. The fact is that I did not say what they claimed that I said. How on earth could I call you a bitch because you are in love with John? <br>\n      Therefore, I am writing this letter to express regret at the break in our relationship. i felt the pains of the break in our relationship when my mother asked of you when I was home last vacation. She found it difficult to forgive me for allowing our little misunderstanding to degenerate to the level that we don't greet each other whenever we meet. I also miss you greatly because when I remember all the good time we have had together, I always feel remorse for my part in the quarrel. As you know that we used to exchange visits during the holiday and you always spent some weeks with my family, my parents also miss you. My junior ones were asking of you when I was home last vacation. They couldn't believe that we could keep each other at arms length. <br>\n      However, I want us to bury the hatchet and be friends again. I want you to believe that I cannot say all those unprintable things that those backbiters claimed that I said about you. We should not allow anybody to bring enmity and bickering between us. I want our friendship to be restored so that we can go back to those memorable days of perfect relationship. I am sure that we will be happy for this. <br>\n      Kunle, my brother. will be celebrating his birthday next month. I am inviting-you to the party. My mummy will be very happy to see you there. Extend my sincere greetings to your sisters and brothers. </p><p>                                                                                                                                   Yours sincerely. </p><p>                                                                                                                                   Titilayo. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                                        PRESS CLUB'S EXCURSION TO O.B.M AND ATLANTIC PRINTERS. </p><p>      Last week, twenty members of our club, the Press Club paid a visit to 0. B. M Advertising and the Atlantic Printers. a B. M is an advertising company while the Atlantic Printers are book printers. What motivated the excursion was that, as members of the Press Club, we wanted to be familiar with the process of producing advertisement, art works, jingles and the workings of a press. <br>\n      On the day of the visit, we left the school by bus at exactly 9am. On arrival at 0. B. M Advertising company, we found that the General Manager. Mr. Martins Nwachukwu, was already waiting for us. He welcomed us very warmly and introduced us to the company's Client Services Director who later conducted us round the various departments of the agency. We visited the Client Service Department where we were shown the accounts of the various companies O.B.M serves. Later, we were introduced to the Copywriter's office. The Copywriter showed us a copy of an advertisement and how to write an advert copy. After writing the advert copy, it is sent to the Artist's office where an artwork will be produced for the advertisement. <br>\n      The second place we visited was the Atlantic Printers. The company has three main sections: the Lithographic section, the printing section and the binding and packaging section. The lithographic section is a two-room air-conditioned apartment. The first room is a dark-room where typeset pages of books are filmed. We were shown the camera used for shooting the films and the machine for developing them. In the second room, there is a plate-making machine which is used for making metal plates from films. The metal plates are the ones mounted on the printing machines at shown to us in the printing section. At the printing section, Mr. Olorunnisola, who was conducting us round the company, showed us two types of printing machines These were a Kord 64 offset printer and a Heidelberg Letter-press printer. According to Mr. Olorunnisola, the offset printer prints words on paper using the metal plates made from the lithographic section while the letter press printer uses cases containing metal type faces instead of plates.<br>\n      Our tour of the binding and packaging section was no less educating and exciting. We saw workers mg papers by hand and binding books using a stitching machine. <br>\n      The excursion really opened our eyes to how advertisements on radio and television are produced by advertisino companies and how books are printed. The visit has actually exposed us to the career opportunities existing in the advertising and printing industries. At the two places, we were given good talks on career prospects in the media and the allied professions. There is no doubt that the excursion has been able to boost our morale and enthusiasm as members of the Press Club.<br>\n <br>\n                                                                                                                                     Abiola Adetunji, <br>\n                                                                                                                                     SSIIC. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Write an article for publication in a national newspaper discussing the causes and consequences of the excessive desire for material wealth among Nigerians.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>         <strong>CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF EXCESSIVE DESIRE FOR MATERIAL WEALTH AMONG NIGERIANS.</strong></p><p><br>\n      In Nigeria today, people struggle to make money everyday and in the process a lot of crimes are committed. This phenomenon has risen to an alarming proportion. It is common nowadays to see Nigerians, especially youths, who want to have all the material comforts in the whole world without being ready to work at all. Even those who have no means of livelihood want to ride posh cars, live in palatial buildings and go about with the most beautiful women of their choices. <br>\n      Excessive desire for material wealth as a common phenomenon nowadays is caused by our society's warped and twisted values. The society as a whole recognizes those who can cut corners and make their wealth without caring to ask how they acquire their wealth. Hard work, as a value, is not cherished by Nigerians. As a result, many Nigerians struggle daily to acquire wealth mostly by crooked means. <br>\n      Furthermore, the government is not helping matters. Government officials at the helm of affairs see their positions as a means and an opportunity to acquire wealth. There have been cases of government officials acquiring wealth at the expense of the tax payers.Government officials, out of greed, fail to provide the necessary social amenities such as pipe-born water, electricity, etc that could make Nigerians have a sense of belonging and comfort. An average Nigerian feels insecu red when thinking about his future. Nigerians believe that it is a sin to be poor in Nigeria. Therefore, they do all sorts of things to acquire wealth excessively when they are still young so that they will not suffer when they become old. <br>\n      Nigerians' excessive desire for material wealth has taken a great toll on the country, especially the country's image. Hardwork and honesty are no longer the best policies as they are not acknowledged and rewarded accordingly. The psyche of every Nigerian has been twisted towards acquiring wealth excessively. This has made many Nigerians to take to crimes like armed robbery, hired killing, fraud forgery. prostitution and drug trafficking. Many Nigerians have lost their lives to armed robbers and hired assassins. Many others lose their life savings to fraudsters commonly referred to as 419-ners. The image of the country has been called to question by the international community as a result of drug trafficking and common occurrences of assassination and armed robbery. <br>\n      The craze for excessive material wealth among Nigerians should give the government concern. All necessary steps towards curbing this malaise should be taken by the government so as to redeem the image of the country. </p><p>                                                                                                                                   Helen Okorie. <br>\n                                                                                                                                   Okeira Grammar School. </p>",

The planet Earth, the only home of man is bathed in a steady rain of the sun's rays. Most of these rays supply us heat and light, but a small percentage is deadly. These are the ultraviolet- B rays (or UV -B). If these were to get to the surface of the earth directly, they would kill us off. Luckily, the earth's surface is shielded from these rays by the ozone layer; but sadly enough this ozone layer is being destroyed by man. The ozone layer is formed from a kind of oxygen with three atoms ( \\(O_{3}\\) ) instead of the normal two (\\(O_{2}\\) ). <br>\n      Ozone occurs naturally in the stratosphere, several kilometres above the earth's surface. It absorbs the dangerous UV-B rays but allows the much needed and safe light to pass through. There in the stratosphere, it is constantly being created by the sun's rays; thus it is a self-repairing shield. But man is now gradually destroying this vital shield with his industrial gases. The most lethal of these gases are the chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, which are used in making all kinds of foamed plastic products, propellants in spray cans, coolants in air conditioners and refrigerators and solvents to clean electronic equipment. <br>\n      Down here, they are not lethal. But after they have leaked from air conditioners, plastic foam, cups, etc, they slowly drift up to the stratosphere where, bombarded by ultraviolet rays, they break up at last, releasing chlorine,the real ozone killer.

Basically, it involves the ability to read through a passage fairly quickly and the ability to understand what has been read. It is a mark of intellectual immaturity to hold on to a passage for hours without being able to make meaning out of it. Also. it is a mark of bad reading not to be able to recall and discuss what has been read. <br>\n      The foregoing has however put the issue rather too simply. The ability to read through a passage at a good rate can be attained only after a mastery of the grammatical structures of the language. Without a sound mastery of words and how they function under various situations, and understanding how sentences are generated, one cannot read even the simplest passage efficiently. Rather, failure would ever dog one's footsteps. <br>\n      Considering the issue from another perspective, merely mastering the vocabulary and structure of the language is not enough. The reader's frame of mind is equally important. Think of a man who is disturbed by the death of a dear one. Such a man would not be able to concentrate on the reading task. If the death, of the dear one is still fresh, he might read through a passage several times without understanding it. On the other hand. if the reader is too excited, he might not be able to concentrate, Take the case of a man who has just read in the newspaper that he has won a handsome sum of money. If he has to read a passage, he may not be able to concentrate. <br>\n      Furthermore, the physical state of the body affects one's ability to read efficiently. So also does the presence or absence of distractions.

        "question": "<p> Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.</p><p> <br>\n      Of all the banes confronting the economies of developing nations, not in the least in seriousness is inconsistency in policy. Apart from the quite obvious factor of frequent changes of governments in these countries, a phenomenon which invariably tolls the death knell of existing policies each time a government is swept out of office, even stable governments themselves seem to have a knack of modifying policies frequently. A leader of government is often regarded as radical, and hence popular, when he shakes up his cabinet. Such shake-ups often lead to a change of policy. <br>\n      Quite often, such avoidable changes reflect the shifts in the leaders' friendship patterns. In the third world countries, a position at the top attracts large number of friends, a phenomenon which engenders keen rivalry for attention among the friends. Back-biting is hence not uncommon, and a favorite who is today regarded with an office may easily get the boot tomorrow. <br>\n      Besides, the poor economic situation, a common cause of social unrest, brings about frequent changes in policy. An economic policy which does not produce the expected result within a short time is usually thrown out, often with the initiators of the policy. Sadly though the fault lies, not so much with the policy as with factors both within and outside, beyond the operators. The truth here is that failure tends to rush leaders into taking rash actions which result in further damage. <br>\n      Finally, quite a number of the sharp changes are dictated, or at least influenced, from outside. In a situation where a weak country decides to embrace a stronger one. it has to contend with some dictation from the stronger partner. To reach an agreement with another country necessarily means modifying operations at home in so far as the agreement affects activities at home. For instance, to take a loan from a stronger country is to tailor one's economic operations to reflect the spirit of the loan agreement. <br>\n      Frequent changes in policy harm development far more than is realized. Apart from the financial wastage brought about by the sudden abandonment of projects when new rulers assume office, the resulting sense of insecurity scares off foreign investors. Besides, inconsistency of policy hinders the concentration of effort on specific projects. Moreover, the frequent abandonment of projects mid-stream, especially those being executed under international agreements tends to suggest to aid donors and leaders that the beneficiaries are not serious. And potential donors and leaders' prefer dealing with serious-minded and committed leaders.</p><p>(a) In three sentences, one for each, state the factors responsible for frequent changes in policy.</p><p>(b) In three sentences, one for each, state the results of the frequent changes in policy.</p>",
