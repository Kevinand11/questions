        "question": "<p>Your school was tipped to win the final match of the inter-school football competition for secondary schools in your state, but unfortunately you lost to the underdog. Write an article for publication in your school magazine on that match, explaining why your school lost and the lessons to be learnt.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                      WHY OUR SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM LOST TO THE UNDERDOG. <br>\n      It was never expected that our football team will lose the final match in the last inter-school football competition. In the state, our school was rated high by lovers of football because of our performances in the competition over the years. Our school had won the cup four times consecutively and this year our confidence was built on the fact that we were going to play with St Peter's High School, a team which had been rated low among the teams in the state. But at last, we lost the match and it is part of history in the state that our hitherto formidable team lost to the underdog. <br>\n      The reasons why our team lost the match are not far fetched. Our team was over-confident. After the semi-final match which we won against Corona High School team which was also one of the highly rated teams in the state, our boys relaxed and all the attempts to gather them to practise could not materialise. The team's coach also shared the views of the players that the final match would be a walk over. Our boys regarded the semi-final match as the final match as they thought that the final match against St. Peter's High School team will not pose any problem. <br>\n      Over-confidence of our team became our undoing as the opponent team rattled our defence and scored the first goal in the fifteenth minute of the first half of the match. The goal destabilised our boys as they struggled to find their feet. They could not score a goal throughout the match as they played out of form, each of them playing out his skill individually. This was our second undoing. Our boys lacked proper co-ordination of their various skills. They failed to play the game as a team and many of their passes were wrongly coordinated as they could not connect one another.<br>\n      Another reason is that they easily gave up as there were bickerings and disagreement among our players. The mistake which the captain of the team made in his passes of the ball irritated many of the of the players and this affected the morale of the players. After the second goal against our team, our boys played lazily and could not find their feet throughout the game. At the end of the match we lost to the underdog team with five goals. <br>\n      There are some lessons we have to learn from the match. Firstly, the need for adequate preparations before any match can not be over emphasized. We should not be over-confident to go to the field of play without making adequate preparations. Secondly, nobody can predict an outcome of a football match as it is not Mathematics. Thirdly. we should not under-rate any team as it is possible for a low rated team to spring up a surprise on the field of play. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Bilikisu Adeyinka <br>\n                                                                                                                                    SS3C <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>.                                     LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP <br>\n      Maria Kobina was the first daughter of her parents. She was loved by her parents who did everything to keep her happy by giving her all she demanded. Her parents relied on her to lead other children in the family with good examples to follow. <br>\n      Maria was sent to school because her parents believed in education. After the completion of her primary education, they sent her to a boarding school. Her parents used to visit her in the school always. They took proper care of her by providing everything she needed so that Maria could face her studies seriously. <br>\n      In school, Maria had a friend called Julie who came from a very poor family. Julie lacked so many things. Though Julie was an indigent student, she was satisfied with what her parents could provide for her. In the first three years of Maria's stay in school, Julie was her only intimate friend while others were just mere classmates. <br>\n      When Maria got promoted to SS2, her attitude and outlook changed. She started going to parties with some wayward girls who were her classmates. At one of the parties, she met Festus and they became lovers. Unknown to Maria, Festus was a houseboy to a rich man who entrusted him with all his belongings, including his fleet of cars. Festus always claimed that he was the only son of the rich man and because he always visited Maria in one flashy car or the other, Maria got infatuated with him. <br>\n      One day, Maria informed Julie, her friend, whom she had almost neglected, about her love affair with Festus. Julie warned her friend against mistaking superficial love for a genuine one. Maria failed to listen to Julie's advice and before long she got pregnant for Festus. When-she told Festus that she was pregnant, it was too late and the pregnancy could not be aborted. Maria kept her pregnancy in secrecy and none of her friends and teachers could detect that she was pregnant because she always tucked out her blouse to conceal the pregnancy. <br>\n      When the pregnancy was about five months old and both the students and teachers became aware, Maria went to see Festus in his master's house. \"Let us run away to my parent's home and we will be there until you are delivered of the baby Festus suggested. Maria wondered whether the rich man's house was not the home that Festus was talking about. Do you mean that I should come and stay here in your father's house in the same town where my parents and mates will find me out?\" Maria asked in confusion \"In my parents home in a village in Cross River State\", Festus replied. It was after Festus' reply that Maria now realised that she had been deceived to believe that Festus was the son of the rich man. She wept bitterly and regretted that she had not looked before leaping.</p>",

As the senior prefect of the school, I have heard several complaints against the members of the teaching staff of the school. My office has been inundated with a lot of grievances, some of them written down in form of a protest letter and some verbally. <br>\n      The first complaint is that many teachers fail to attend classes to teach the students. The fact is that they are either absent from school or they refuse to come out of the staff-room to teach the students during their various class periods. They are always absent from classes and this has resulted in students being idle most of the time. In most cases, the students are left unoccupied to roam the school compound. <br>\n      The second grievance of the students is that teachers come late to school everyday. Most days, students do not have teachers on duty to conduct the morning devotion for them. Therefore, the students are left to go to classes without the normal morning assembly and prayers. This also affects the first two lessons which most students miss simply because teachers come late to school. Similarly, there are cases of teachers coming late to school in the morning and when they eventually come, they will sit down in the staff-room discussing irrelevant things instead of going to their classes. <br>\n      The students also complained about teachers' lazy attitude and failure to prepare adequately before going to teach. Many of them do not have lesson notes and when they have, the notes are haphazardly prepared. This has made their teaching disjointed and uninteresting according to the students. There are other grievances such as male teachers making love advances to female students. I would want you to investigate this allegation properly. <br>\n      In view of all these complaints. I would be shrinking in my responsibilities if I fail to inform you that the students are planning secretly to riot. In order to avert this riot, therefore. I would be delighted if you could correct all these anomalies so as to bring sanity and restore a sense of duty in the members of the teaching staff. Please sir. it demands urgent attention as nothing else can make the students change their minds. <br>\n                                                                                                                                     Your faithfully, <br>\n                                                                                                                                     (Signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                     Chukwuma Nnoli. </p>",

        "question": "<p>The Political Science Students Association in one of the higher institutions of learning has invited your school to participate in a debate on the topic: Civil Rule is Preferable to Military Rule. Write out your speech for or against the motion.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                CIVIL RULE IS PREFERABLE TO MILITARY RULE <br>\n      Good morning. the Chairman. President of the Political Science Association, Head of Department, Political Sci-ence, Students, invited Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am delighted to be in your midst this day to support the motion which states: 'Civil Rule is Preferable to Military Rule. <br>\n      Civil rule refers to governance according to a body of laws and rules popularly known as constitution which guides the conduct of government in a country. There is no doubt that civil rule or democracy is the most acceptable form of government throughout the whole world today. In fact, civil rule is the antithesis of military rule which is the governance of a country through the barrel of the gun. <br>\n      Democracy or civil rule has its own peculiarities and attractions. Civil rule as aptly defined by Abraham Lincoln is the \"government of the people by the people and for the people\" In a democracy. power resides in the people through which they have the right to exercise their voting rights. The common people have the right to choose their representatives in the legislative and executive arms of government. These political rights can never be violated in a genuine democracy. The citizens have control over the excesses of their rulers and they can curb their excesses by voting any abominable government out of office or by impeaching it.<br>\n      On the contrary, military rule violates the rights of the citizens. It legitimizes the use of force and the citizens are ruled under the military, by the whims and caprices of the soldiers who subject the civil society to the rigidity of the laws of the barracks. The soldiers are not answerable to the citizens, unlike civil leaders who are accountable to the citizens from whom they get their powers. <br>\n      In addition to this. civil rule promotes the formulation and implementation of good policies and programmes that are people oriented. Civil leaders think only of the benefit that the people they govern can derive from a programme before they implement it. The military does not consider it as most of its programmes are formulated and implemented in accordance with the whim of the military administrator. <br>\n      In this way, civil rule ensures the employment of good hands in governance. Civil leaders are usually tested hands who have proved themselves one way or the other in their chosen fields of human endeavour and professions. They bring their expertise and diverse professional experiences to bear on governance. Therefore, they always embark on enduring and long-lasting programmes and projects. The soldiers are shortsighted. This makes their projects to be mere fanciful and white-elephant ones that are transient in values and qualities. <br>\n      Democracy, if allowed to thrive is the most stable form of government. It guarantees all the fundamental human rights, press freedom inclusive. as it is written in the constitution of the country. These rights are grossly violated under the military who continually roll out decrees and edicts with the aim of silencing the people. <br>\n      The vogue today, Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, as far as governance is concerned is democracy. A nation wh is still under a military dictatorship is always regarded as a pariah nation. The people, the world over, want to have who a say in how they are ruled. It is civil rule that can give them this opportunity. Military rule only denies them this opportunity. This reason and other ones earlier mentioned make civil rule preferable to military. Thank you </p>",

I am indeed very sorry for my failure to write to you since I changed from Abeokuta Community High School to Okeira Grammar School six weeks ago. I am just settling down in my new school. <br>\n      I know that you may be thinking about what could have led me to change my school. Uncle the reasons are not far fetched. As you know that I am a science student and that the science syllabus is very wide. I need a school where there are enough teachers teaching these science subjects and a school which has got a track record of laudable achievements in science. In my former school, however, the teachers handling these subjects are inexperienced and incompetent, going by my estimation and rating.<br>\n      Furthermore, my former school lacks good laboratories and a library. Imagine a school with only one laboratory being used for all the three main science subjects. To make the matter worse, this laboratory was not equipped and whenever we were going to have our practical lessons, we usually go to the neighboring school for them. <br>\n      However, since my resumption in the new school, I always have the feeling that I have got to a school of my choice. There are lots of interesting things about my new school but I will mention only three of them One of them is the availability of competent and qualified teachers. There are enough science teachers and two for each of the science subjects, one teacher handles the practicals while the other handles the theoretical aspect. The methods of teaching by these teachers, to say the least, are fantastic. Other subjects are also handled by hardworking and dedicated teachers. Regular assignments are given to us after every lesson.<br>\n      Secondly. my new school has reliable laboratories and a big functioning library with relevant and up-to-date text-books. Any science student has access to the equipment in the laboratories and we are free to borrow books from the library. <br>\n      Thirdly, the school environment is conducive to learning The classrooms are very spacious with ceiling fans and other facilities meant to make students comfortable There is a football field good toilets for students and a big assembly hall with public address systems. <br>\n      Uncle, I know that you will now understand why I had to change my school. How are your business and family? I hope that things are going on very well Extend my greetings to your children and wife.</p><p>                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely, <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Dele.</p>",

It was such a terrible and calamitous fire that brought destruction of properties and commodities worth millions of naira and a suicide case on its trail Just last week, a woman who lost all that she had in the market committed suicide because of what she described in her suicide note as \"a great loss.\"</p><p>      The fire started at 12.30pm in the afternoon when the market was in progress. I was in one of the provision shops adjourning the electrical appliances shops. The inferno started in one of these electrical shops due to wrong connection which led to a great explosion. What started as a mere explosion resulted in fire which razed down the whole market.</p><p>      When the shop where the fire started. was engulfed in fire, the shop owner and those who were there with him shouted fire! fire!! fire!!! A pandemonium started as traders and customers run helter skelter,. People run for their lives out of fear instead of putting out the fire and nipping it in the bud. The fire spread quickly to the next shop which, unfortunately, contained a ferry can of petrol concealed in one of the corners. This further helped the spread of the fire which spread uncontrollably to other parts of the market. The situation became worse as some shops near the electrical shop harboured explosives like carbide. The fire became a great conflagration within an hour and before the fire fighters could come around, looking for water to combat the fire. the whole market had been razed down.</p><p>      However, further occurrence of such outbreak of fire should be averted The market would have been saved if in shops had not been built so close to one another. This makes the fire to spread so rapidly. The shops should be built n blocks leaving a gap between one another.</p><p>      There should also be an enlightenment campaign organised for traders on how to put out fire instead of running into a stampede whenever there is a fire outbreak. A system of evacuating goods and people out of the market in case of a fire outbreak should be introduced in the market. Finally. fire brigades should be positioned near the market and they should be equipped with all the necessary facilities to combat fire in an emergency.</p>",

        "question": "<p> Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it. <br>\n      Do the present policies on those who commit crimes reflect a class war? For long, people have alleged that certain laws discriminate against <ins>some members</ins> of the society while such laws favour others. Besides, some sociologists also claim. that .some members of the society are more prone to some specific crimes than others. So, our opening question is <ins>pertinent</ins>. <br>\n      When we realize that armed robbery and similar offences require the use of brute force, it immediately becomes clear that these are offences almost exclusive to the masculine world. The offences are thus sex bound. Besides, the need to be physically strong and agile tends to exclude the upper middle-age and the elderly; so, age is also a factor, Moreover, members of the working class, who at least have some financial returns to rely on, hardly ever have the urge to resort to violence.. This tends to limit violent crimes to the unemployed, poor and <ins>desperate </ins>males in their late teens, twenties, or early thirties. Indeed, if elderly citizens are involved, they function as the barons, the financiers, who sit back at home while <ins>they let loose the dogs of vandalism and death</ins>. They provide the money and tools for the front line criminals. <br>\n      Similarly, drug pushing tends to be more <ins>prevalent </ins>among the weaker sex, especially ladies in their twenties. They are biologically more attractive, and hence more likely to wade through the airport and border post while hiding deadly gramms of hard drugs within one or other of their bodily crevices. Again if older citizens are involved it is more as the barons, shielding the carriers from prosecution if they are caught. So, this is another crime that is largely sex-bound. <br>\n      Punishments for offences limited to the citizens on the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder appear to be harsher. So, robbery with violence attracts death, and pushing hard drugs attracts long jail terms. Meanwhile, pen robbery and large-scale fraud, offences which are invariably specific to the high class officials, do not attract <ins>severe </ins>penalties. Indeed, most culprits at this level manage to wriggle out of the net of the law. <br>\n      There thus appears to be sufficient reasons to answer our original question in the affirmative. <br>\n(a) Mention any two yardsticks used by the writer to categorize those who commit violent crimes. <br>\n(b) What two roles do the barons of the identified crimes play? <br>\n(c) Among what group of people are violent crimes most common? <br>\n(d) (i) Does the writer consider the punishment for the various crimes mentioned in the passage as fair? <br>\n(ii) Support your answer with a brief description of the writer's argument. <br>\n(e) ...they let loose the dogs of vandalism and death.

Never, since the first man and woman were joined together, has the institution been beset by as many problems as it is now. And this trend, which started in the Western World, has spread and is spreading to all parts of the <ins>globe</ins>.  <br>\n      The most disturbing problem is the high rate of divorce. It is no longer a social <ins>stigma </ins>for women to fill in forms indicating that they are divorced; men. too, proclaim their liberty from the shackles of matrimony somehow with pride. Little wonder that young couples resort to separation and eventually divorce. at the slightest disagreement. <br>\n      The availability of <ins>an alternative</ins> aggravates the seriousness of the problem. Instead of entering into matrimony, very many couples simply decide to live together. Even the courts now recognize such common law marriages, and respect the rights of partners in such associations. The great advantage this accords the partners is the fluidity of the association, the ease with which one or both can call off the union. <br>\n      Besides, very many countries now <ins>enact </ins>laws that recognize the rights of children born out of wedlock. This singular factor has helped to shoot up the number of such children in many civilized communities. A recent survey in an urban college shows that about forty percent of the students were born out of wedlock. <br>\n      Not less among the factors hastening the death of the marriage institution is the progressively rising cost of living. Nowadays, it is essential for both partners to be gainfully employed to be sure of a reasonable decent level of existence.

In Africa, a tribal chief was turned away from enrolling in a class because there were no more chairs. The next day, he and a contingent of his fellow chiefs were waiting outside the door, each carrying his own chair.</p><p>      This revolution is not limited to the developing world. In the United States there are more than fifty million students attending more than 185,000 public and private schools at all levels. There are more students today in the United States than there were city residents only forty years ago. We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury which gives some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex industrialized society. Levels of education which were once regarded with awe have now become Commonplace. And jobs which once could be filled with possession of strength and native intelligence now call for a college degree. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.</p><p>      It is a mistake, however, to confuse skill with education. A man who has been taught only to hold a job has not been educated; he has only been trained. And the man who has merely been trained is not fully qualified to take his p a free society as a fully participating citizen. An all-round education should equip the learner for any challenges he may encounter.</p><p>      Education, of course, is not something that is acquired just in college. It is a life-long task and when I think of death, I think of it as the moment when the brain ceases to inquire and expand.</p><p>(a) In four sentences, one for each, summarize the instances given by the writer to show that education is spreading at a very rapid rate.</p><p>(b) In two sentences, one for each, state the reasons given by the writer to support the view that education is changing fast.</p>",
