        "question": "<p>You have been invited by a youth organization to speak on 'Indiscipline among youths'. Write your speech.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>SPEECH DELIVERED BY DR. MURPHY ODUKOYA ON INDISCIPLINE AMONG YOUTHS AT A PUBLIC SYMPOSIUM ORGANISED BY THE YOUTH CLUB OF IKEJA ON THE 18TH OF DECEMBER 1990. <br>\n      The Chairman. President and worthy members of the prominent youths' club, distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. I am very happy to be among you this afternoon I was highly honoured when I was asked to come and deliver this talk on the rightly chosen topic: 'Indiscipline Among Youths. <br>\n      There is no other appropriate time for this topic than now when the whole country is sinking under the heavy yoke of indiscipline. Indiscipline is any action. utterances and societal behaviour that run contrary to the norms, customs, laws and conventions of the society. It is prevalent among youths who often channel their youthful energy and agility towards actions and behavioural patterns which negate the rightful societal norms, actions and behavioural expectations. <br>\n      Flagrantly, youths disrespect elders and constituted authorities They indulge in criminal activities like frauds, popularly known as 419, forgery, violent assassinations, robbery. violent demonstrations, prostitution and other forms of indiscipline. <br>\n      Why are our youths so much involved in indiscipline? This is a serious question that should agitate the minds of every meaningful Nigerian. Mr. Chairman. and Ladies and Gentlemen. the reasons are not far fetched. Indiscipline starts from the home. It is obvious today that many parents fail to find time to train their children. Parents abandon their wards to nannies when they are babies and to teachers in the schools when they grow up to school age. As a result of the economic depression in the country, parents who should be taking care of the children go out very early in the morning to come back late. It causes indiscipline among youths in the sense that parents no longer have time for their children. They usually go out early in the morning and come back late in the night. Some parents are drunkards and cocaine addicts. What moral lesson will such parents give to their children? <br>\n      Peer group influence is another factor responsible for the decline in discipline among our youths. There is truism in the biblical saying that bad company corrupts good manners. Some youths are greatly influenced by their bad friends. They easily join their mates who smoke Indian hemp. sniff cocaine and do some other horrible things. Female youths easily go into prostitution so as to augment the income they can get from their. parents. <br>\n       Similarly, societal influence has caused a decline in the level of discipline in our society. Our society encourages indiscipline. Nigerians worship money and those who acquire. material wealth by crooked means are praised instead of being treated with scorn. It is the belief of most youths that it is a great sin to be poor in the country and that they must have wealth by all means. This has made them to embrace all sorts of evils like bribery, embezzlement, fraud and forgery which, they believe, bring money. <br>\n      However, can the situation be altered? What future do our youths have? I still believe that there must be a way out. After all, when there is life, there is hope. This means that if we want to eradicate indiscipline among our youths, all hands must be on deck. The home which is the nucleus of the society and the government must be ready and committed to inculcate discipline in our youths. I want to use this opportunity to advise all parents to spare time to train their children and teach them moral lessons. Parents should also give them sound education because the youths are the leaders of tomorrow. The future of our country depends on how well we train our children. <br>\n      In addition, our churches and mosques have a lot of work to do in this matter They should be the epitome of good manners and they should give moral lessons to encourage our youths to be of good behaviour.<br>\n      Finally. the society should always praise and reward hardwork, exemplary display of discipline, honesty and other good virtues. Indisciplined youths, drug peddlers, fraudsters and robbers should be reprimanded and treated with scorn When we implement these suggestions, we would have been on the way to achieving a disciplined society. </p>",

I wish you a successful and fruitful tenure i in office and I strongly believe that your tenure will bring rapid development to our locality and to the nation in general. God will surely guide you towards the path of peaceful reign and may you never derail from your plans for our local government area as you stated in your manifesto before election. <br>\n      However, I wish to use this medium to draw your attention to two priority needs of the people in our area. As you know, Ikeja Local Government area is populated by people who are mostly farmers. Our area would have been the food basket of the state if the past chairmen had paid attention to the needs of the farmers. Farmers in the locality are hardworking but there is no incentive for them. I am sure that if they are encouraged through the provision of farm implements and tools. chemicals and fertilizers, they can feed the whole state. Since you are the chairman of the grass root government that is very close to them you would do much to boost their morale if you could take it as a matter of priority and urgency to provide all the necessary chemicals and implements for them. <br>\n      In addition to this. our locality needs good roads which will link our locality with the urban cities in the state. If we have good road network, it will help the farmers and other categories of people living in our area It will encourage the people from outside the area to set up agro-based cottage industries in the area where they can get raw materials for their products. Moreover, your government will be able to generate a lot of revenue from this development which I believe is going to be a deviation from the past administrations who had always relied on tenement rates and revenue realized from local markets. <br>\n      I wish you success in your tenure as the chairman of our local government council.<br>\n                                                                                                                                  Yours faithfully. <br>\n                                                                                                                                  (Signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                  Idowu Sobowale.<br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p>You have just spent your holiday in another part of the country with a friend. Narrate your experience to other friend: describing what you found interesting about the customs, food. dress and way of life of your hosts.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>      It was quite interesting to spend the last long vacation among the Idoma people of Benue-plateau region of the t country. I went to Otukpo, to be precise, to spend my holiday with my friend, Adinoyi. The fact is that I enjoyed every bit of my stay in Otukpo because everyday, I was exposed to a different culture, tradition and ways of life of some people quite different from mine. <br>\n      Benue-Plateau region, prior to my visit to Otukpo, had been just a mere geographical region on the Nigerian socio-political map. In fact, the first idea I had about the culture and belief of the Idoma people came to me through my intimate friendship with Adinoyi. But then, it had remained abstract until I had the opportunity to travel with him to Otukpo during the last holiday. <br>\n      I had a whiff of the people's culture and tradition the first day Adinoyi and I got to Otukpo. Our journey from Lagos to otukpo took the whole day as we started off on the journey very early in the morning and got there around 10.00 pm in the night. Immediately, we got there, I was introduced to the people living in the neighbouring huts surrounding Adinoyi's parents. Soon after the introduction, adults and small children who had gathered listening to moonlight tales came around the but Where I was and they started singing and dancing welcoming me into their midst. I was surprised at the spontaneous outburst of songs and dancing but my friend told me that it was how the Idoma people welcome their special guest. I was fascinated by the hospitality of the people which I later discovered was part of their life. It was their tradition to make their guests comfortable by providing all convenience for the guests. Despite the fact that we got to Otukpo late in the night, sumptuous meal was prepared for me and I had to eat sitting among the villagers. This happened every time I had to eat. They justified this act of eating among a large crowd of people as a demonstration of the spirit of communality. <br>\n      Another custom of the people that fascinated me is their belief in hardwork. My hosts believe that a guest should be regarded as a guest for two days after which he would be invited to go to the farm with them. I found this custom very interesting. On the third day of my stay among the people, I had to go to the farm with my friend's father and I worked in his farm with the traditional hoe of the Idoma people called 'Abele'. <br>\n      Their mode of dressing is very simple and fascinating. Their young girls and women go about in simple garments made from heavy local fabrics similar to Ghana's 'kente. The men put across their bodies wrappers usually of white stripes on black background and tie the wrapper in knot on their right shoulders. This mode of dressing always leaves half of their chest bare which they claim is a display of their manliness. The old men and adults among them usually complement their dressing with a walking stick, On the bodies of the young ladies and women, there are tattoos which they regard as embellishment to their beauty. <br>\n      In terms of courtesy, the Idoma people cannot be found wanting. They stoop and squat to greet each other and in one greeting, they would ask about the welfare of everything that one has, including one's pets. This always takes some of your time and the people will squat and stoop in greetings every time they see you in a day. <br>\n      The most interesting aspect of their life is that an Idoma adult male has to demonstrate his capability to protect his spouse. His manliness will be put to task during the traditional marriage rite. He is flogged on his bare body by a team of strong men until there are lacerations of sore caused by the strokes of cams he receives on his body. The suitor's ability to withstand the flogging will demonstrate his ability to protect his spouse. <br>\n      I so much love the tradition. custom and the way of life of my hosts that at the end of my stay in Otukpo. I had to shed tears when the departing entertainment was being staged in my honour at the town's arena. </p>",

I hope you are recovering quickly now after the successful surgical operation I was very happy to hear that you can now move around the ward by yourself. I am sure that very soon you will join us in the school. <br>\n      However, you have missed some interesting events which happened in the past three weeks. The inter-schools debate competition which you had been preparing for before your illness incapacitated you came up a fortnight ago. Other debaters from the other schools asked of you. 'Where is the girl who is very skilled in debate in your school?, they were asking. I know that you would have loved to participate in the competition because it would have been another forum for you to display your polemical skill. Furthermore, you would have made new friends during the competition. Charity, your classmate was chosen to replace you as the lead speaker and our school came second. Our school and St. Peter's Commercial School. which came first in the competition are to represent the state in Kaduna in August. <br>\n      Moreover. our Literature in English teacher. Mr. Aje, took us to the National Theatre to watch the University of Lagos Theatre Group. the Olokun, performing Wale Soyinka's 'The Trial of Brother Jero on stage. It was quite interesting watching the drama performed live. What a great miss? I know you will be regretting missing this. Don't worry. our teacher has promised to organise another drama presentation of the play soon. <br>\n      Finally, we had our inter-house sports competition at the playground of the Teachers' Training College. It was a colourful sports competition attended by several schools within our vicinity. Yellow House emerged the overall winner while Red House came second. Blue House, your house came third and won a shield.<br>\n      The members of the Press Club and the Dramatic Society miss you greatly. They are all asking me when you are going to resume in the school. They all wish you a quick recovery.

        "question": "<p>Write an article, for publication in a national newspaper, on the dangers of drug abuse among youths.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                                     THE DANGERS OF DRUG ABUSE <br>\n      Drug abuse has become a matter of constant discussion on the radio, television and in the daily newspapers recently. The menace of drug abuse in our country has reached a frightening proportion and it has pervaded every sector of our society. Drugs, which are made from medicinal substance formulated by pharmacists for the cure of people's ailments, is used wrongly and abused by people across the social strata. A lot of people just walk across to the nearby chemist to their houses to buy drugs which are not prescribed for them by a pharmacist or a doctor, thus abusing the drugs. <br>\n      There are lots of dangers in drug abuse In fact, many families have endangered the live of their members through self medication There are cases of many small children who lost their lives simply because their parents, out of ignorance, purchased drugs from chemists and even in the common markets without any doctor's prescription and administered such drugs on their children.<br>\n      In our society nowadays. it is common to see young children with one deformity or the other. This is so because many pregnant women abuse drugs easily They simply buy drugs and use them without doctor's prescription during pregnancy. The resultant effect of this ignorant act is that most babies are born with one deformity or the other. <br>\n      Drug abuse also leads to the several psychiatric cases we have around in the country. Several youths take drugs such as heroine cocaine Indian hemp which affect their brain They take these drugs ostensibly because they want to be in fashion and they want to be daring and bold Consequently. most of them constitute themselves into nuisance to the society and end up in psychiatric hospitals.<br>\n      Our national prestige and honour are not spared of the gruesome effect of the social malaise called drug abuse. Many Nigerians travelling abroad are subjected to derogatory search at the points of entry into other countries. This has destroyed our international image as many Nigerians are found to be carriers and couriers of these hard drugs. <br>\n      Many crimes in the country can be linked to drug abuse The high rate of criminal activities is a pointer to the danger inherent in drug abuse Armed robbers and the like operate under the influence of drugs which make them to be so daring and ruthless in their nefarious activities. <br>\n      It is certain that drug abuse has posed a lot of dangers to our society and the government has to do something about it. Our people need to be enlightened about the dangerous consequences of drug abuse. Mass enlightenment campaign should be organised by the government. In addition, the government should promulgate a law which forbids the sale of drugs in the common open market and there should also be a law which forbids a chemist from selling drugs to the public without prescription paper from a doctor or a pharmacist. Religious bodies also have a role to play in educating the public about the dangers of drug abuse </p>",

        "question": "<p>As the Senior Prefect in your school, write out the speech you would give on the occasion of your school's end-of-year ceremony. Mention some of the problems you faced and give suggestions on how they could be solved.</p>",
        "answer": "<p> The Chairman, Board of Governors, The Principal The President of Parent-Teachers Association, Members of staff and students, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen it is with great pleasure and a deep sense of humility that I stand before you this afternoon as the out-going senior prefect of our great school to deliver my valedictory speech <br>\n      Exactly a year ago, the mantle of leadership of the students of this school fell on me. Then, I felt too small for the responsibilities which the post brought on me. However, with the power of God and the encouragement of both the Staff and students, I was able to forge ahead and overcome all the numerous challenges of the office. This is the reason why I am able to stand tall before you this afternoon.<br>\n      Mr. Chairman, Principal, Ladies and Gentlemen, there is no doubt that in the last one year, the school has been able to record considerable progress especially in academics. The Lagos State Government donated two hundred thousand naira for the development of the school. In addition to this, the Parent-Teachers Association donated a bus for use by the school. These achievements are possible because of my administrations good rapport and disposition towards the school authority and the P.T.A.<br>\n      In academics, as I mentioned earlier, the school was so outstanding that the governor of the state developed a great interest in our school. Our school represented the state in the National Essay Competition organised by the Mobil Petroleum Company and won a prize in the competition. Despite the numerous and laudable achievements recorded, there were problems which confronted my administration. An adage says: 'uneasy lies the head that wears the crown'. It is not an easy task, you will all agree with me, to be the head of students of about two thousand and five hundred in population. <br>\n      The first problem that confronted me was how to make the school compound clean. What I realised initially was that to make the school clean, the filthy habit of the students had to be changed. I differed with my mates on the suggestion that we should set up a student task force to enforce cleanliness. I realised quickly that this will create more problems than solutions. What I did was to enlighten the students on the need to have a clean environment and I created dustbin centres at strategic and conspicuous places where refuse is gathered before it is taken to the central incinerator for burning. <br>\n      Lateness to school by students was another problem that my administration faced. In solving this problem, I had to work in conjunction with the school authority. I discouraged flogging as this made students to be truants; when they come late to school they will refuse to enter the school and prefer to while away the time outside. Instead, any student who came late to school was made to serve punishment after school while those students who came early to school went home in the afternoon. Late comers waited behind to serve punishment, thus going back home late. This worked out well as many students made it a point of duty to rush down to school. <br>\n      Perhaps the greatest problem I confronted during my tenure was that of bullying in the school. I had been a victim of bullies when I was in junior classes and so I was very strong in my determination to wipe out any form of bullying and other forms of oppression prevalent then among the senior students. In line with my determination. I set up the students' secret police (SSP) whose identity was known to me and the members of staff only. These students were very vigilant and all unruly behaviours exhibited by any student were reported for appropriate disciplinary actions. Through this measure, I was able to exterminate such evil or bad anti-social behaviours from the school. Today, bullying has become a thing of the past. <br>\n      My distinguished audience. \"a tree\". an adage says \"does not make a forest\". These achievements could not have been possible without the co-operation of my fellow prefects who worked assiduously and tirelessly to make sure that we realise our dream. My thanks also goes to the school authorities, members of staff of the school and the entire students . I sincerely thank you for your cooperation and encouragement. Finally, I thank this gathering for listening attentively to my speech. <br>\n                                                                                                                                     Dele Farayola <br>\n                                                                                                                                     (Out-going Senior Prefect 1990.) </p>",

Visitors early that morning were shocked at the way the doors were vandalized  before the robbers forced their way into the living-room to make away with the radio, the television, the wall clock, and the video cassette recorder.</p><p>      As some sympathizers discussed the perfection with which modern robbers strike nowadays, a few of them drove to the police station and soon arrived with detectives. Quickly, statements were obtained from the couple and a few neighbours, all in an attempt to pin down  suspects. From these statements. it was learnt that the bushes and uncom-pleted houses nearby had not been searched. The officer ordered his men to comb  the bushes and the unfinished structures. While this lasted, he stood over the culvert near one of the buildings.</p><p>      Thoroughly, from room to room, from tree to tree, the searchers toiled. But it was a fruitless exercise. The help rendered by neighbours did not yield clues. At last, the police boss concluded that the robbers were beyond their reach, and so called off their chase.  He blew his whistle and ordered his men into the jeep.

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions on it.</p><p>      A study conducted in Nigeria recently recognized three varieties of spoken English. Speakers of the first variety exhibit characteristics of a very long and difficult process of 'internal interpretation from the mother-tongue into English. Thinking and expression do not go closely together. A listener would notice this from the way the speaker pauses before expressing himself, apparently deciding which words to use and how to arrange them. Thus, thinking is exclusively through the medium of the mother-tongue and English is thus a poor shadow of the original thoughts of the speakers. Utterances heard invariably have to be translated silently into the mother-tongue to be maximally meaningful, and then responses are translated from the mother-tongue into English. Consequently, the long, indirect routes make statements slow, halting and jerky.</p><p>      The second variety speakers exhibit features described above but to a much lesser degree. internal translations from the mother-tongue to English still take place during the speaker's expression of opinions and complex concepts but the process now takes a shorter span of time. With ordinary words or simple ideas, internal interpretations need not intervene between the points at which the thought is conceived and the time it is given verbal expression. Discussions are quicker and smoother though these might not always be entirely free from minor halting gaps.</p><p>      With the third variety speakers, thought is almost entirely in English and translation is not needed. The speaker has a wealth of linguistic weapons to choose from to express the minute distinctions between similar concepts - and these come quickly and easily. Thus for instance, whereas speakers of the lower varieties have only the word 'rain', the speaker of variety III recognizes distinctions between 'shower', down-pour' drizzle'. 'mist'. 'deluge', etc.. and uses each in the appropriate context. Also, his mastery of the sounds and features of the English Language equips him to express the utterances accurately and automatically without having to pause and think of the correct version of a sound since he masters the various distinctions in the pronunciation of each vowel and each consonant.</p><p>      We need to recognize, however, that most Nigerian learners of English 'graduate' from one variety to another, from the lowest stratum of variety Ito the highest stratum of that variety. and then to variety II and so on until they achieve variety III. Length of periods of education. exposure to standard English and a personal conscious effort play major roles in deciding what variety a particular speaker uses.</p><p>      Finally, we must recognize that most speakers of the higher varieties are still capable of reverting to the lower ones, if they choose. Thus we can find even a Nigerian professor of phonology switching to the lowest stratum of variety I if he feels so inclined when discussing with a house-servant or a porter.</p><p>(a) In three sentences. one for each, summarize the distinctive characteristics of the speakers of the three varieties of English described in the passage.</p><p>(b) In two sentences, one for each, describe the conditions under which a person can:</p><p>(i) move from lower varieties to the upper ones: (ii) switch from a higher variety to a lower one.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(i) The speaker of the first variety of English translates his thoughts and words silently before making a meaningful statement. <br>\n(ii) The second speaker goes through the same process as the first but within a shorter time <br>\n(iii) The speaker of the third variety speaks fluently exhibiting the knowledge of vocabulary and pronunciation. <br>\n(b) (i) A person can move from lower to upper variety if he has long period of education and gets exposed to standard English <br>\n(ii) A person can move from higher to a lower variety if his listener is of lower educational ladder. <br>\n </p>",
