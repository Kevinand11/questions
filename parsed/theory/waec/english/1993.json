        "question": "<p>The topic of an essay competition organised by the Young Writers Club for final year students is: Our traditional marriage system is more suitable for the present generation of Nigerians than the English system. Write your entry for or against the topic:</p>",
        "answer": "<p>             OUR TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE SYSTEM IS MORE SUITABLE THAN THE ENGLISH SYSTEM.</p><p> <br>\n      The infiltration of our culture and tradition by western values has led to a lot of dislocations in our society. In marriages nowadays, there are cases of divorce and separation because Nigerians of the present generation have neglected our traditional marriage system for the English. I still support our traditional marriage system and I believe strongly that it is more suitable for the present generation of Nigerians. <br>\n      The traditional marriage system forbids a man to marry a woman without seeking the consent of the woman's parents. Not only this, it encourages the two parties to be involved in marriage to investigate each other's lineage and character. The coming together of a man and a woman is gradual which can take years of courtship and relationship during which the character. reputation and the honour of the families involved are put on the line. The lineage of the man and the woman is usually traced and if there is any reason to discourage the union like the existence of hereditary disease or a social stigma in any of the parties family lineage, the people are always cautious not to join them as husband and wife.<br>\n      Furthermore traditional system discourages immorality and bad behaviour among youths. An eligible bachelor is such a man who is of good reputation and manner. The same thing applies to the spinster. A wayward and promiscuous girl will find it difficult to get a reasonable and responsible husband, and in the same manner, a drunkard male may remain unmarried for a long time if he doesn't change.<br>\n      Moreso, traditional marriage system should be preferable to the present generation of Nigerians because it is cheaper. Unlike the English system which encourages high society and church weddings, traditional marriage ceremonies are very cheap. The couple just need the members of their respective families to contract a marriage deal. It is bereft of the fanfare pomp and pageantry that is usually associated with the English marriage ceremony. <br>\n      Finally, traditional marriage system discourages hypocrisy in all forms. A potential husband or wife is seen by the society according to his or her home training behaviour and comportment as well as his or her family history. The religious pretensions and hypocrisy encouraged by the English system don't have a place in our traditional marriage system. </p>",

I have been detained for six months now without being charged before a court or tribunal. <br>\n      What your men accused me of is armed robbery. It happened that I was walking down Oyegbusi Street in Igbotako around 8:00 pm in the night. Many people were walking along the road side like myself and few vechicles were moving in a free flowing traffic. Suddenly, I heard gunshots and like other passers-by, I noticed that some policemen were gun shots with six men in a relatively new peugeout 505 car. There was a great pandemonium, and confusion was let loose as people ran helter skelter to save their lives. I ran blindly across the street, looking for a place to hide myself. <br>\n      In the bid to look for a house nearby to run into, I noticed that all the shops and houses were locked. I, therefore, myself at the back of a house using the back fence of the house as a coverage. I was still in my hiding when two policemen came to arrest me and threatened to shoot me down if I attempted to run. <br>\n      I later learnt that the armed robbers abandoned their car and while two of them were killed in the shoot out, four of them escaped into the labyrinths of the houses around. As your men claimed, it was their search for these escaped armed robbers that led them to my hide-out. <br>\n      All my pleadings with your men fell on deaf ears and all attempts made by my relatives to see me were foiled by the police. I have since then been detained under inhuman conditions for a crime I do not know anything about. <br>\n      I would be very grateful if you could look into my case and effect my release. <br>\n                                                                                                                                   Yours faithfully, <br>\n                                                                                                                                   (signature) <br>\n                                                                                                                                   Francis Aiyejina. </p>",

        "question": "<p>You witnessed the campaigns that preceded a local government election in your area in which the favourite candidate was defeated. Give a vivid account of the events before, during and after the election to your friends, explaining why you think the candidate lost.</p>",
        "answer": "<p>                        AN ACCOUNT OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTION <br>\n      Chief Harrington Kingsley, my favourite candidate lost to a less colourful politician Mr. Joseph Oluchi in a manner which showed that politics is all about intrigue. All along Chief Kingsley has been known as the man of the people. He has along trail of experiences in politicking and governance to back up his candidacy. He is an accomplished account-ant with outstanding achievements to show for it. <br>\n      I can still not believe that Chief Kingsley lost the last local government election to Mr. Oluchi. The campaign was the last in the series of campaigns that preceded the election where the contestants had to address the electorate and answer questions from the press. Going by the public rating of the two contestants before the last campaign, the people's opinion poll favoured Chief Kingsley as everybody had tipped him to be the winner of the election. <br>\n      The venue of the last campaign was inundated with posters of the two contestants. The women's wings of the two parties outdid each other in dancing and in songs. The two contestants were carried shoulder high by their respective supporters who engaged themselves in wild dancing as they were shouting their slogans. Chief Kingsley's charisma and string of achievements attracted a large number of supporters to him.<br>\n      Soon after this, the contestants were asked to take their seats on the rostrum in preparation for the question and answer session of the campaign. Chief Kingsley initially showed his brilliance in answering questions, put across to him for the first few hours of the interview. Then. it was time for a journalist who supported Chief Kingsley s opponent to ask questions. His question as to whether Chief Kingsley would probe the last administration threw off the chief. Chief Kingsley's answer that he would probe the last administration because it was an open secret that it was corrupt, gave his opponent the leeway to plan an intrigue. Chief Kingsley's open declaration of his intention was indeed a mistake because it made it possible for his opponents to convince even his supporters not to support him again. <br>\n      I believe that Chief Kingsley lost his election because of this unguided utterance as politicians don't like to be probed. As a result of this, they ganged up against him and he lost to a less popular Mr. Oluchi who was ready to compromise. </p>",

I hope that you are doing very well. I know that you must have been expecting my letter. Why I have not been able to write you since is that I was trying to adapt myself to the new environment I found myself. <br>\n      Tayo, to say the least, I regret changing my school because my present school does not live up to my expectations. When I resumed in the school there are some facts. I discovered about the school which made me to regret changing my school. <br>\n      Firstly. my new school lacks good laboratories. As a science student, I find this disgusting. The science laboratories are not equipped at all. The rooms referred to as laboratories here cannot pass for a normal classroom in my former school. In fact, one can't call them laboratories. To make matters worse. there are no equipment; what you can get there are few test tubes and one or two bunsen burners. <br>\n      Secondly, the school has no library. In the whole school there is no library where students can go to read and borrow relevant books. This fact goes to show me that my former school is relatively good going by the big library there. Alas, I didn't realise this until I got to this school. <br>\n      The situation is further worsened by lack of qualified and committed teachers. The school has no qualified teachers to handle most of the subjects. Unlike my former school where there are two teachers for each of the major science subjects and English Language, there are no teachers to teach us Physics and Chemistry here. Even the teachers in other subjects are not committed to their duties. Therefore, we often miss our lessons and through this a lot of time is wasted. <br>\n      You can now see the dilemma in which I find myself. If I had known, I wouldn't have changed my school. It is a long time you wrote last. Please write so that I can know how you are doing in your studies. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely. <br>\n                                                                                                                                    Kemi. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>                         SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT <br>\n      The importance of science and technology in nation I development cannot be over-emphasized. It is a known fact that no nation can develop without science and technology. What is science and technology? Science is the study of knowledge which can be made into a system science and which depends on seeing and testing facts while technology is the practical  application of scientific knowledge. Developed nations of the world like the Soviet Union. Germany. France. U.S.A etc. boast of several scientific inventions which make them to be rated as the world powers. <br>\n      Science and technology is the pivot of any nation's development. A nation without science and technology is definitely a backward nation. Such nation  will be considered undeveloped. Science and technology is associated with modernity and it is an essential tool for rapid development. Modern gadgets in all aspects of human comfort are inventions of science and technology Electricity, aircraft, telephone, television, computers and other forms of machinery could not have been invented technology.<br>\n      Science and technology. Science and technology is also very essential in the production of medicine and treatment of diseases. A nation which lacks the necessary science and technology in this area will have to depend on other developed nations for the existence of its people. Such a nation can not be said to be independent because it has to depend on the whim and caprices of other nations with the necessary science and technology. <br>\n      The development of a nation depends solely on the amount of science and technology at the disposal of such nation. A strong and virile nation is a nation ion with adequate technology to make its people comfortable. A nation without science and technology cannot feed ls people because agriculture requires the application of science and technology. <br>\n      Furthermore, science and technology helps in the area of employment. The rate of unemployment is high in Nigeria simply because many graduates of science are either under-utilized or unemployed. This is so because there is no scientific and technological development to match the number of graduates churned out of our universities every year. Nigeria too can join other giant nations of the world if our government could spend more money on science and technology. This is the only way the country can launch itself into limelight and world recognition as a developed nation. </p><p>                                                                                                                                    Kunle Adebena <br>\n                                                                                                                                    SS 3A.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>IF I HAD KNOWN HE WAS THAT KIND OF PERSON, I WOULDN'T HAVE GONE OUT WITH HIM. </p><p><br>\n      I met Peter in a birthday party of one of my family friends, the Nwaifors. Tinyan. who was my intimate friend. was celebrating her twentieth birthday and I had gone there since in the morning on that day to rejoice with her. <br>\n      I noticed Peter Nwadolor when he arrived in company of his friends, John and Paul. I was charmed by the rousing welcome accorded him and his friends by my friend and other members of the family. Tinyan introduced him to me as her cousin and we shook hands. <br>\n      Peter struck me as a man with great comeliness. He was finely cut with pleasant eyebrows and well-arranged set of teeth. His handsomeness came to the fore when he smiled. Soon after the introduction, he gave Tinyan a fat envelope which contained money and asked my friend's junior sisters to go and bring the present he brought from his car downstairs. <br>\n      \"He must be a rich man\". I said to my friend Well he is comfortable\" Tinyan replied. \"He is a young promising business man\" she added. I kept quiet and 1 struggled hard to concentrate on what I was doing. There was no doubt that I had already fallen in love with Peter. But soon after Peter was introduced to me, he called my friend and told her that he was going somewhere and that he would come back in thirty minutes' time. <br>\n      Around 7.00pm in the evening the party started and people began dancing. By this time, Peter had not come back and I decided that I would not dance with anybody until he came. I was moody and at certain times, I went into my friend's room to sleep on her bed.<br>\n      When it was 11.30pm. Peter arrived with his friends, dressed in a big flowing \"agbada\". He now looked like a rich businessman than a mere struggling boy that I had seen in the afternoon. He smiled broadly at me when it was my turn to shake his hands and I reciprocated willingly with a broad smile I was very happy when Peter requested me to dance with him. We had a pleasant time together that night and we later became lovers. <br>\n      I was in love with him and though he lavished a lot of gifts and affections on me, he refused to take me to his home. I asked Tinyan several times whether her cousin was married and she told me, each time I asked that she was sure that Peter was not married I pestered Peter several times to take me to his house but he only promised he would do that when it was time. Since I didn't want this to break our relationship, I stopped pestering him.<br>\n      My joy knew no bounds one day when Peter told me that the next week end he would come to pick me to his house. The Friday he promised I woke up early to get ready for his arrival He came and we soon arrived at his duplex. He took me to his bedroom and I was undressing myself when three giant men rushed in and seized me They tied me with a rope. While this was happening I didn't see Peter He came in later with an old man who looked fearful with charms all over his body. He made some incantations after which he went out of the room with Peter. After some time, the three men who tied me and shaved my hair came in and started loosening the rope. <br>\n      They set me free and led me through the back door with a threat that I would lose my life if I discussed my ordeal with anybody. I came to know that Peter was a kidnapper who got his wealth from fetish means. If I had known that he was that kind of a person I wouldn't have gone out with him. </p>",

        "question": "<p>Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions on it.</p><p>       The food and oil crises demonstrate the extent of our interdependence. Many developing nations need the food surplus of the developed nations. And many industrialized nations need the oil production of a few developing nations.</p><p>      Energy is required to produce food, and food to produce energy - and both to provide a decent life for everyone. The problems of food and energy can be resolved on the basis of cooperation — or can, I should say, be made unmanageable on the basis of confrontation. Runaway inflation, propelled by food and oil price increases, is an early warning signal. Let us not delude. ourselves. Failure to cooperate on oil, food and inflation could spell disaster for every nation.</p><p>      The United Nations must not, and need not allow this to occur. A global strategy for food and energy is urgently required. It is my belief that four principles should guide a global approach.</p><p>      Firstly, all nations must substantially increase production. Just to maintain the present standards of living, the world_ must almost double its output of food and energy to match the expected increase in the world population by the end of the century. To meet aspirations for a better life, production will have to expand at a significantly faster rate than t population growth. Second, all nations must seek to achieve a level of Prices which not only provide an incentive to producers but which consumers can also afford. It should now be clear that the developed nations are not the only countries which demand and receive adequate returns for their goods. But it should also be clear that by confronting consumers with production restrictions, artificial pricing and the prospect of ultimate bankruptcy, producers will eventually become victims of their own actions. Third, all nations must avoid the abuse of man's fundamental needs for  sake of narrow material or bloc advantage.
