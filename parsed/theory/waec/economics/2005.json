When the highest income is attained at the wage of the $40 the supply curve bends backwards towards the price axis as the labour market experiences the income effect.

This may mean that new competitors, probably producing low volume of output, would be faced with higher per unit cost and so would not be able to compete effectively In the market.<br>\n(ii) Legal monopolies: Created by law e.g. public utilities like the Post office<br>\n(iii) Patent and copyrights: Patent on an invention or innovation.
