This implies that revenue should be raised without causing undue hardship to the tax payer.</p><p><strong>(ii) The Revenue yield: </strong>From the standpoint of the government, the total revenue that tax yields is of considerable importance. Governments are comfortable with . taxes that provide a fairly predictable and steady in-come.</p><p>(iii) <strong>Economy</strong>: Consideration must be given to the cost of collecting a tax, since high cost incurred in administering a tax may make it uneconomical for both the tax payer and the government.</p><p><strong>(iv) Neutrality: </strong>An important consideration in evaluating tax is how the tax affects production, savings and people's willingness to work. A good tax system should not interfere unnecessarily with the supply and demand for goods and services.</p><p>(v) <strong>Convenience</strong>: The method and time of payment should be convenient to the tax payers.</p><p><strong>(vi) Benefits - Received principle: </strong>It is argued that those who benefit most from government supplied goods or services should pay the taxes necessary for their financing. For example petrol taxes are typically ear-marked for financing road construction and repairs. Toil gates. etc.</p><p><strong>(vii)Certainty:</strong> Governments and the tax payers should know about the amount, time, method of tax payments with certainty.</p><p><strong>(viii) Flexibility:</strong> The tax system should be flexible enough for adjustments when the need arises.</p><p><strong>(ix) Simplicity: </strong>Taxation should not be difficult to administer and understand. It should not cause problems of differences in interpretation.</p>",
