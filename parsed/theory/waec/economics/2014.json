        "answer": "<p>(a) A specific tax is a tax that is levied at a fixed rate per unit of output.</p><p>(b)(i) A specific tax is a post of production, the effect is a reduction in supply from S\\(_{1}\\)S\\(_{1}\\) to S\\(_{2}\\)S\\(_{2}\\) by the amount of tax as the diagram below. A reduction in supply cannot ad to an increase in price because the demand for the commodity is perfectly price elastic. The entire burden of a specific tax falls on the producer who is unable to increase his price. Equilibrium quantity falls from q\\(_{2}\\) to q\\(_{1}\\) while price remains the same. </p><p><br>\n(ii) A specific tax will make the market price of a commodity that has a perfectly inelastic demand to rise by the full amount of the tax.
