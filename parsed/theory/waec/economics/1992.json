        "answer": "<p>The law of demand states that \" The higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded\". The demand curve slopes downwards from left to right. However, this may not be so in all situations due to the following:</p><p><strong>(a) Goods of ostentation:</strong> Some consumers take pride in buying goods whose prices are high. The higher the price, the higher the quantity demanded. Example of ostentatious goods are expensive jewelries, gold watches.</p><p><strong>(b) Articles of necessities:</strong> Some items are considered essential to the extent that people cannot do without them. Examples are garri, salt etc. The low income earners prefer sacrificing other items at the expense of these ones. Therefore, the higher the price of these items, the higher will be the demand for them. <br>\n </p>",

This leads to an increase in output.</p><p>(ii) Time is saved in division of labour because no time is lost in moving from one stage of production to the other.</p><p>(iii) Division of labour makes the use of machine possible at each stage of production. This leads to better and increased production.</p><p>(iv) Specialists handle various aspects of production in division of labour. This leads to innovations and sometimes, inventions.</p><p>(v) Since each worker on the production line does only one aspect of the production process, the worker experiences less fatigue.</p><p>(vi) In division of labour, one person is responsible for an aspect of production on which he concentrates his efforts and skill. With time, the individual's skill improves</p><p>(vii) With the use of machinery, various type of technology are developed to further facilitate production.</p><p><strong>(b) Factors.that are capable of limiting the practice of division of labour are: </strong></p><p>(i) The level of technology sets a limit to the extent of specialization. New technological break through may allow further specialization.</p><p>(ii) The nature of the product may not give room for division of labour e.g barbing, hairdressing and driving.</p><p>(iii) In the field of Creative art, division of labour is limited because, individual talent is all important and works cannot be mass-produced.</p><p>(iv) A small market discourages mass production and hence, division of labour. If the market is large enough to absorb sizable quantities of the product, it will encourage division of labour.</p><p>(v) Mass production requires factor inputs in suitable quantities and qualities.

        "question": "<p>Discuss the different types of agricultural systems that exist in West Africa. </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>Types of agricultural systems that exist in West Africa are as follow: </strong></p><p><strong>(i) Peasant farming system: </strong>This involves the cultivation on a small scale acres of land. Farms are small units owned by individual families. This is also referred to as subsistence agriculture because it is the production of agricultural products for direct consumption by the producers and their families. This system impedes mass agricultural production.</p><p><strong>(ii) Plantation farming:</strong> This is large scale farming on plantation or estate. This system of agriculture allows for a high degree of mechanization and other aspects of modernization. Capital intensive methods are often employed. Such crops planted on plantation farming include cocoa, tea, cotton, rubber and sugar cane. Moor-plantation in Ibadan is an example of modern agricultural practice. It could be owned by individuals or government.</p><p><strong>(iii) Mechanized farming:</strong> This involves the extensive use of machines and other types of advanced mechanical devices in agricultural production. Mechanized agriculture ensures large scale production because human labour is replaced with that of machine such and tractors, harvesters, incubators etc.</p><p><strong>(iv) Co-operative farming: </strong>This is a type in which co-operators may own a large expanse of cultivable land together and work and share the product of their labour. This type of farming is adopted in order to obtain loans and aids from government. This system also allows for mechanization. <br>\n </p>",

These products are in their primary condition and are perishable.</p><p><strong>(iii) Large number of middlemen:</strong> As a particular product passes from one middle man to another, arise in the price of the product is expected.

This has seriously affected distribution of goods in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>(vi) Administrative bottle necks in the collection and handling of goods:</strong> This problem affects all manufactured and agricultural products.
