Acts of parliament - This is power conferred by law on a firm to be the sole producer or supplier of a particular commodity<br>\nii. Copyright - This is a legal right granted to the producer or seller of a book, play, film or song to be the sole seller for a specific period of time.<br>\niii. Natural monopoly- A situation which makes a firm (because such a firm owns a unique raw material, technology of some other factor), supply a market's entire demand for a good or service, at a price lower than two or more firms can e.g. the utility firms<br>\niv. Cartel - A cartel is an agreement between two or more producers of the same commodity to regulate the production and sale of the product with a view to obtain dominance in the market e.g OPEC. </p>",
