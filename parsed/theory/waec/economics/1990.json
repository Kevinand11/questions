        "question": "<p>(a) Distinguish briefly but clearly between opportunity cost and money cost. </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)Opportunity cost is the alternative forgone. The opportunity cost of a product is the alternative which must be given up in order to produce that product. It is the sacrifice made in order to enjoy something else. For example, if a student has N5 to buy either a book or a shirt. If he buys a shirt instead of a book, the opportunity cost is the book which the student has forgone in order to buy the shirt. Money cost, on the other hand, refers to the total amount of money that is spent in order to acquire a set of goods and services. This tallies with the accountant concept of cost. For example, a consumer who spent to buy a shirt has dispensed with cash. The N15 spent is the money cost.</p><p>(b) The concept of opportunity cost is relevant to the economies of West African countries. This is because the concept emphasises the basic problem of choice which is the main core of the subject matter of economics as a result of the limited available resources vis-a-vis unlimited wants. Since every economic problem involves choice and every choice involves opportunity cost, therefore, opportunity cost is relevant to the economies of West African countries. The concept involves efficient allocation of scarce resources to pressing needs of the society. It also shows that every activity involves a sacrifice whether on the side of an individual, a firm or a government. The government will decide which sector will take the lion's share of the resources of a country. It helps in government decision-making process. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Despite having about 75% of their labour force in agriculture, West African countries cannot meet their domestic food requirement because of the following reasons:</p><p>(i) Climatic conditions vary from area of excessive rainfall to areas of excessive drought. These two types of climatic conditions are detrimental to crop and animal growth.</p><p>(ii) The farmers lack requisite technical knowledge and modern skills to raise the standard of farming and agricultural production in their countries.</p><p>(iii) West African farmers still use crude implements such as cutlass, hoes etc for farming. They have no opportunity for mechanized farming.</p><p>(iv) The sale of products is limited to their immediate environment because of poor transportation and communication systems.</p><p>(v) The imbalance in urban- rural economy has led to rural -urban drift. Agriculture has thus been losing its vital labour force without replacing it with mechanization.</p><p>(vi) Land tenure system encourages small scale farming. Modern agriculture is difficult under the existing land tenure system which makes the transfer of ownership of land extremely difficult.</p><p>(vii) Pest and diseases reduce the quality and quantity of agricultural products since farmers cannot afford to purchase insecticides. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>Inflation can be defined as a persistent rise in the general price level of goods and services. This occurs when the volume of purchasing is permanently running ahead of production and too much money is chasing too few goods.</p><p><strong>Various governments in Nigeria have attempted to combat inflation through the following ways:</strong></p><p>(i) It is argued that inflation is caused by increased money supply and the government have been reducing the supply of money using the instruments of open market operation, cash-deposit ratio, moral persuasion etc.</p><p>(ii) The government has introduced some fiscal measures to reduce inflation. Fiscal measures can be implemented by means of increased taxation and reduction in government expenditure.</p><p>(iii) Industrialization will reduce over reliance on imported goods and bring about increase in output which will reduce prices.</p><p>(iv) Reduction in aggregate money supply can be achieved through a reduction in government spending.</p><p>(v) The activities of hoarders should be checked to prevent increase in prices of goods.</p><p>(vi) The use of effective price control system through the establishment of Price Control Board </p>",

In other words it is the sum total of all the incomes received by the factors of production within a period of time.</p><p>(i) National income statistics assists the government in planning economic development. Successful planning re-quires fairly accurate figures upon which decisions can be based.</p><p>(ii) Average per capita income can easily be obtained if the national income is known.</p><p>(iii) National income statistics are used to indicate the overall standard of living of the people. The larger the size of income, the higher the standard of living of the people, provided that the income is equitably distributed.</p><p>(iv) The data gathered on people's expenditures, incomes and outputs will put investors in a position to know whether it is worth investing their capital in the country or not.</p><p>(v) National income estimates are used to compare the living standards of different countries. This is done on the basis of average income per head.</p><p>(vi) National income statistics also give vital information about the different sectors of the economy, their rate of growth, their needs for resource allocation.</p><p>(vii) National income figure can show at a glance whether or not the country's economy is growing from year to year and at what rate.</p><p>(viii) National income statistics will indicate areas of greatest needs in terms of resources allocations and appropriate measures will be taken to correct the imbalance. <br>\n </p>",
