        "answer": "<p>(a) How the human ear carries out its function of balancing; </p><p>- Head movement in any direction affect the fluid/endolymph, In the semi-circular canals, Which are at right angles to each other, The movement forces the sensory/hair cells in the ampulla to set up the impulses, The brain interprets the impulses and relays the impulses to the body muscles for balancing.</p><p>(b)(i) Diagram of the Human Ear;</p><p><img alt=\"Open Photo\" src=\"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/p206x206/237608260_433315604586745_7009314379469924529_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=aee45a&amp;_nc_eui2=AeEAAXrmLKLsqXA_gWI686d14KiKuy5i_nvgqIq7LmL-e3Prktlt4Q9VpHBSr_gHRrkYrrH7JoUFDEkJeufsoVEH&amp;_nc_ohc=SEUM93RuYWkAX8c74Ou&amp;_nc_ad=z-m&amp;_nc_cid=0&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.xx&amp;oh=1580df27466ce2582788fb7772c6c16c&amp;oe=6144334D\"></p><p>(b)(ii) Description of the structure of the middle ear; The middle ear is an air filled chamber, It connects the ear drum of the oval window fenestra ovalis. It contains three bones/hammer/malleus, anvil/incus and stapes/stirrup/ear ossicles. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane/tympanum/eardrum. Each of the bones has direct contact with the one next to it, the eustachian tube is formed at the base of the middle ear . The eustachian tube links the ear to the throat/pharynx.</p>",

In the dihybrid inheritance in heterozygote the pairs of alleles are found on different pairs of chromosome, Only four types of gametes are produced in approximately equal numbers.</p><p>(ii) Blood grouping in humans; Is determined by three alternative genes/alleles A, B and O. A person can only possess two alleles of the genes on a pair of homologous chromosomes. Gene O is recessive to both genes A and B which are dominant/co-dominant and possess antigen A and B in the red blood cells hence it is possible to have blood group A as AA (homozygous) or AO (heterozygous) and blood group B as BB or BO, Blood group O can only exist genotypically as OO and does not possess antigen A or B in the red blood cells or in the homozygous recessive state.</p><p>(b) Classes of Vertebrates in their Evolutionary Trend;</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:700px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Class of Vertebrates</td>\n<td>One Example</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pisces/Osteichthyes/Chondricthyes</td>\n<td>Tilapia; Tuna, Salmon, Shark, Dogfish, Catfish, Skate, Ray</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amphibia</td>\n<td>Frog/Toad</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reptilia</td>\n<td>Snake, Crocodile, Tortoise, Turtle, Lizard, Wall Gecko</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aves</td>\n<td>Dove, Pigeon, Parrot, Weaver Bird, Hawk, Eagles, Domestic Fowl</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mammalia</td>\n<td>Human, Monkeys, Rat, Rabbit/Guinea pig</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><p> </p>",

Interaction among various populations lead to competition which may result in the elimination of one species or its restriction to a non-competitive position, Plants sometimes compete by producing toxic chemicals that inhibit neighboring species, there also exists predator-prey relationship/association between animals all these forces act together to achieve dynamic equilibrium in the habitat.</p><p>(e) Problem that Organisms in Intertidal Zones of Marine Habitats could Encounter; Tendency of being carried away by waves drying up/desiccation/exposure to air, varied osmotic balance oxygen deficiency, low light intensity for producers, reduced visibility in animals, fluctuation of water temperature..</p><p>(f) Reasons the following factors are necessary for germination; </p><p>(i) Moisture;- A seed imbibes/absorbs moisture causing the seed to swell and the testa becomes more permeable to oxygen and carbon (IV) oxide.
