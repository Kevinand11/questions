It is as a result of short eyeball, or the lens and ciliary muscles which has lost their elasticity, Light rays from near objects are normally focused behind the retina</p><p>(ii) The defect can be corrected by using a convex lens which coverages the light rays entering the eye to focus on the retina. Long sight is corrected by convex lens. The convex lens shorten the focal length, converge rays of light entering the eye from near object to focus on the retina. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/92%2011.jpg\" style=\"height:330px; width:300px\"></p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)<br>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/92%20111.jpg\" style=\"height:273px; width:300px\"></p><p>The female reproductive system of human consists of two ovaries located below the kidneys. Close to each ovary is the oviductal funnel which lead into the fallopian tube or oviduct. The fallopian tubes are narrow spiralling tubes that lead down into a wider tube called uterus or womb. The two horned uteri join up to form vagina. The narrow lower end of the uteri which lead into the vagina are called the cervix which regulates the opening of the vagina. The urethra opens into the vagina to form a common passage called the vestible which serves as urinogenital tract. This has an opening through vulva? <br>\n(b)</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mammals</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Amphibians</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>(1) Fertilization is internal<br>\n(2) Development is internal  (vivaporous) or born young ones alive<br>\n(3) Placenta is present </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> -Fertilization is external<br>\n -development is external  (oviparous) lay eggs<br>\n -No placenta </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><p>(c) Description of male reproductive organ of a flowering plant: The male reproductive organ of a flowering plant is known as androecium which is made up of stemens. Stamens are made up of stalks called filaments, which carry the anthers. The anthers are made up of pollen sacs which contain the pollen grains containing the male gametes. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)(1<strong>) Voluntary action</strong> - involves the response to a stimulus that is controlled at will by the brain. in this action, an impulse is carried from a sensory neurone via the spinal cord to the brain which interprets and sends the message back through the motor neurone to effector organ. The action is not automatic. e.g. running, writing, jumping, laughing, reading, smiling.</p><p>(II) Involuntary action or reflex action-It is a rapid or automatic response to a stimulus. It does not involve the brain for initiation. Therefore, the action is not under the control of the will, e.g. sneezing, coughing, knee jerk, salivation, secretion of grand, blinking</p><p><strong>(b)(i) Functions of insulin: </strong><br>\n(1) Assists in oxidation of glucose to produce energy<br>\n(2) regulates the amount or level of glucose in the blood<br>\n(3) assists in protein synthesis in some cells</p><p><strong>(ii) Functions of auxin </strong><br>\n(1) Promotes lateral bud development<br>\n(2) promotes reproduction, flowering and fruit formation in plants<br>\n(3) promotes the production of adventitious roots. </p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/92%202.jpg\" style=\"height:97px; width:400px\"></p><p>(c) Experiment to show that plant roots respond positively to gravity:</p><p><strong>Aim </strong>- To demonstrate that plant roots respond positively to gravity.<br>\n<strong>Apparatus</strong>: A bean seedling, Wet blotting paper, damp saw dust, cupboard.<br>\n<strong>Procedure</strong>: Put some dust on a wet blotting paper and place the bean seedling on the saw dust horizontally. Carry the set up and place it inside a dark cupboard to eliminate light for few days.<br>\n<strong>Observation</strong>: When observed after few days, one will discover that the root has curved and growing downwards while the shoot grow upward. <strong>Conclusion</strong>: Since the root has grown downwards and the shoot upwards, we can say that roots respond to gravity, showing positive geotropism while the shoot shows negative geotropism. </p>",
