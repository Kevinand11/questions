        "question": "<p>(a) Describe the general arrangement of the viscera of a named mammal.</p><p>(b) Describe the process of feeding in (i) Hydra; (ii) Amoeba. <br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p><strong>(a) </strong>The general arrangement of the viscera of man or rabbit shows that the diaphragm divides the trunk into two unequal parts namely, the upper chest cavity and the lower abdominal cavity. The chest cavity is enclosed or encircled by the ribs in which the lungs and the heart lie. The gullet runs down behind the mouth or buccal cavity through the whole length of the thoracic cavity, through the diaphragm. The liver lies below the diaphragm which over-laps a large portion of the stomach. The stomach leads to the small intestine which itself leads to the large intestine. The large intestine forms the caecum at one end and continues to form the rectum at the other end which finally terminates at the anus which lies at the posterior end of the trunk. Very close to the stomach are the pancreas and spleen. At the back of the abdominal cavity, we have a pair of kidneys. In male, the male part of the vasa diferensia are seen at the posterior region in close position with the bladder and ureter. In female, ovaries lie near the kidney, and the oviducts lead to the uterus or womb which is in the lower part of the abdominal cavity or behind the urinary bladder.</p><p>(b)(i)Hydra feeds mainly on small aquatic organisms.<br>\n-Food is captured by the help of nematocysts, borne on the tentacles.<br>\n-The food is then taken into the wide mouth by the tentacle.<br>\n-Here enzymes are secreted by the gland cells.<br>\n-digested extra cellularly and partially absorbed into endodermal cells.<br>\n-Here digestion is completed intra-cellularly.</p><p>(ii) Amoeba feeds on micro-organisms, e.g. diaton or organic particles. During feeding, it engulfs the food particles by forming cup shape. When the two ends of the pseudopodia touch, they fuse and enclose the food with little amount or drop of water and these form a food vacuole. The food is digested and absorbed here.<br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)To demonstrate the effect of auxin on growth of a plant shoot, cut off the growing tip of coleoptile or shoot of three potted maize seedlings A,B, and C. Get three agar blocks A.B.C. Place one of the cut tips on an agar block A, so that the auxins in the tip can diffuse into the agar block. Then put three drops of IAA or Synthetic auxin on agar blockB. Put agar blocks A and B on one side or on top of the cut tip of the coleoptile or shoot A and B respectively. Then place the untreated agar block C on the side or tip of third cut coleoptile or shoot tip C as control experiment. Leave the three coleoptiles or shoots in unilateral light for 12 to 36 hours. The Coleoptiles or Shoots carrying agar block A and B show growth curvature while C shows no growth curvature. This shows that auxin promotes growth</p><p><strong>(b)The use of auxin in agriculture are: </strong></p><p>(i) Auxin helps to induce ripening of fruits.</p><p>(ii) It also helps to produce lateral bud development in stem</p><p>(iii) It helps in controlling weeds as well as controlling flowering and fruiting in plants.</p><p>(v) It assists in breaking seed dormancy.</p><p>(vi) It helps to initiate adventitious roots in stem cuttings and for parthenocarpic fruiting.</p><p>(c) Mechanism of transmission of impulses through a nerve fibre is characterised by change in electrical, potential and ionic charge. When at rest, the outside of the nerve is positively charged while the inside is negatively charged. Chemically, the nerve fibres possess potassium ions which are concentrated inside the fibre, while sodium ions are concentrated more on the outside. The change in permeability of the cell membrane is brought about when the fibre is stimulated and sodium ions enter the nerve while potassium ions move to the outside. The change in permeability along the nerve or change in electrical potential and ionic change along the fibre cause the movement of the electrical current along the fibre. In this way, the impulse is propagated or transmitted while the original resting stage of the nerve is restored as soon as the impulse passes. <br>\n </p>",

        "question": "<p> (a)(i) Explain the term courtship behaviour in animals.<br>\n(ii) How does courtship aid reproduction in animals?</p><p>(b) Describe the process of fertilization in flowering plants.<br>\n </p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a)(i) Courtship behaviour in animals consists of instinctive behaviours in response to certain external stimuli. The behaviour is usually carried out in sequence and alternately performed by male and femal organisms. Each step acts as a stimulus for the next step. It may involve territorial defence, display and pairing. Examples are found in some birds, fishes and mammals.</p><p>(ii) When courtship behaviour coincides with ovulation or reproduction period, mating occurs, leading to release of gametes and, therefore, increase in the chances of fertilization or reproduction.</p><p>(b) The flower possesses pollen grains which contain the male gametes and the ovules have the female gamete. The pollen grains are transferred from the pollen sac or anther to the stigma during pollination. On the stigma, the pollen grain absorbs sugary fluid and swells until the extine bursts and intine grows into a pollen tube along the style. The nucleus divides into tube and generative nuclei. The generative nucleus divides into two male gametes. One male gamete fuses with the egg cell or Ovum to form Zygote while the other male gamete fuses with pollar nuclei to form the endosperm nucleus which matures to form the nutritive endosperm. The Zygote forms the embryo after several divisions. The whole ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes fruit. </p>",
