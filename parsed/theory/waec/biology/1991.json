        "answer": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/91%2022.jpg\" style=\"height:150px; width:400px\"></p><p>(b) The mechanism of hearing in mammals begins with sound waves first reaching the pinna and passing along the auditory meatus to the ear drum. This causes vibration which passes along the ossicles. The ossides amplify the vibrations which are transmitted to the inner ear via the oval window. This sets the endolymph in the inner ear (cochlea) to vibrate. Impulses are then set up by the hair cells of the cochlea and transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain for interpretation.</p><p><strong>(c) Care for the ear:</strong></p><p>(i) Clean ear regularly with cotton wool or swab to remove dust and wax.

The consumers or animals feed on the producers or their products. Consumers release carbon (iv) oxide to the plants to take in.

This means that those that cannot stand the test of competition die. This eventually leads to reduction in population. Lack of these necessities also leads to migration which reduces population size.</p><p>(ii) <strong>pathogens</strong>: These are disease causing agents or organisms which kill other organisms in a population thereby reducing the population. Attack by pathogen can result in the development of resistant strains which eventually lead to a growth of disease free population.</p><p>(iii) <strong>Water</strong>: All living organisms need water for survival.<br>\n(1) Water is needed for metabolism.<br>\n(2) Lack of water leads to food scarcity and death, thereby reducing population.<br>\n(3) Adequate supply of water leads to increase in food production and supply which eventually leads to increase in population.<br>\n(4) Excess water supply may result in flooding which brings about displacement and reduction in population. <br>\n </p>",

This makes the osmotic concentration of guard cell to reduce. Water is lost lay the guard cells through osmosis to the surrounding. This makes the guard cell to be flaccid, hence stoma closes. </p>",
