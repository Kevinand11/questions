        "answer": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/classroom/editor_images/88%201.jpg\" style=\"height:209px; width:300px\"></p><p><strong>(ii) Functions of two organelles are :</strong></p><p><strong>Mitochondrion</strong> — This serve! as centre for cell respiration. It is often called the cells power house. Glucose is broken down here and stored as A. T. f (Adenosine triphosphate) and released as needed by the reE of the cell.</p><p><strong>Chloroplast </strong>— It possesses the green pigmer chlorophyll. Therefore, it is the site of photosynthesis.</p><p><strong>(b) Two levels of cell organisation in living organisms are: </strong><br>\nTissue This is a group of cells that are similar in structure and function It performs specific functions in living organisms. Examples tissues in plants are xylem, phloem, mesophyll, etc. In animal we have the bone, cartilages, etc.</p><p><strong>Organ </strong>— This is a group ( several different tissues with special functions e.g. in plant we have the root, leaf, stem etc and in animals we have th heart, eye, lungs, skin, ears, liver, etc. </p><p>(c)(i)Osmosis is responsible for the movement of water or materials from one cell to another, usually from low( concentration to higher concentration, e.g. absorption of water or mineral salts from the soil by the root hairs. animals, it is responsible for the movement of water into the contractile vacuole in paramecium.</p><p>(ii) Diffusion play important roles within an organism and its environment, e.g. gaseous exchange in organisms, exchange of nutrient from maternal blood, diffusion of food from the placenta to the foetus, transfer of food and oxygen from the intestine into the villi and from the tissue fluids into the cells. </p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)Modes of nutrition in plants are: </strong></p><p><strong>(i) Autotrophic or holophytic nutrition</strong> — It is a process by which green leaves or plants manufacture their food using atmospheric carbon dioxide and soil water as raw materials with sunlight as the source of energy. This type of aytotrophic nutrition is the photosynthetic nutrition. The other type is the chemosynthetic nutrition where energy is derived from the breakdown of inorganic compounds.</p><p><strong>(ii) Parasitic nutrition</strong> — It is a process by which some plants depend on other plants (as the host) for food and protection. A parasite harms its host by causing some set back during the relationship.</p><p><strong>(iii)Mutualism (symbiosis) </strong>— This involves two organisms living together for the mutual benefit of each other. It may be between organisms which belong to the same group or different groups, e.g. nitrogen fixing bacteria, rhizobium and leguminous plants and fungi and algae in lichens.</p><p><strong>(iv) Epihytic nutrition — </strong>This happens when plants attach themselves to other plants for support. They obtain minerals and water from the point of attachment to the host plants but manufacture their food through photosynthesis because they possess green leaves.</p><p>(b) (i) Light reaction occurs in the grana of the chloroplast which contains chlorophyll, a light absorbing pigment. The absorption of light energy by chlorophyll helps to split water molecule into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions: 4H\\(_2\\)O Light energy 4H\\(^{+}/) \\(_H\\)OH — 4OH\\(^{-}/)   <br>\n                                                                                                                                             →<br>\nThe hydroxyl components react further to form water and oxygen: 2OH + 20H &gt; 2H20 + 02 .</p><p><strong>Summary of reactions: </strong>4H\\(_2\\)O radiant energy 4H\\(^{+}/) + 2H\\(_2\\)O + O\\(_2\\) + 4e-</p><p> In the process, electrons are transferred to photo system I, two molecules of ATP are synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphate. ADP + P1→ ATP (photophosphory— lotion) electrons move further to another photosystem 1. NADP is reduced to NADPH and two molecules of NADPH are produced.</p><p>(ii) Dark reaction takes place in the stoma of the chloroplast in the presence of NADPH and ATP. The Hydrogen (H) formed in the light reaction undergoes series of reactions in which they reduce carbon dioxide to form sugar (glucose): Co\\(_2\\) + 4H → CH\\(_2\\)O + H\\(_2\\)O. The reactions are catalysed by enzymes.</p><p>(c) (i) <strong>Filter feeding in mosquito: </strong>The head possesses brushes, mandible and maxillae. Ventral surface of the head is upward and this enables the pair of brushes at the sides of the mouth to sweep through water and entangle small food particles which are combed into the mouth by the maxillae and mandibles.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Parasitic feeding in tape worm:</strong> The head (scolex) possesses hooks, rostellum and suckers. The hooks and the suckers enable the organism to attach itself to the walls of the intestine of its host. The entire body is used to absorb digested food from its host. </p>",

This reduces population.</p><p>(2) <strong>Competition </strong>— It is the tendency to struggle for the little available food. This is survival of, the fittest.</p><p>(3)<strong> Loss of weight</strong> — There is loss of weight by individuals which brings about low energy out put</p><p>(4) <strong>Diseases </strong>— There is malnutrition due to shortage of food which results in deficiency, diseases and reduction in the resistance of organisms to infection etc.</p><p>(5) <strong>Death </strong>— Organisms may die of starvation due to long period of food shortage.</p><p>(6) <strong>Famine </strong>— Little food is available to go round the population thereby resulting in severe famine.</p><p><strong>(c)(i)Methods of improving crop yield: </strong></p><p>(1) <strong>Use of fertilizer </strong>- Fertilizer should be applied before or after planting to increase the fertility of the soil and this will in turn increase yield. During application of fertilizer, you may broadcast, ring or use the side placement or folia method. Example of fertilizer is NPK. Ensure that fertilizer does not come in direct contact with growing crops.</p><p>(2) <strong>Crop rotation </strong>— This is a system of cropping whereby crops are planted on the same piece of land with each crop following the other in a definite sequence during the same farming season. The piece of land may be divided into five plots and different crops planted on these plots every year in a definite order. Ensure that crops of the same family are not allowed to follow each other in the sequence. Deep rooted crops should follow shallow rooted crops and leguminous crops should be planted on the fallow plot in the sequence.</p><p><strong>(ii) Methods of preserving and storing food: </strong><br>\n(1) Canning — Foods are preserved in cans or sealed containers. Before storage, heat treatment is applied to prevent spoilage.<br>\n(2) Refrigeration — Low temperature inhibits the growth and spread of micro organisms.<br>\n(3) Drying and salting<br>\n(4) Pasteurisation<br>\n(5) Additives<br>\n(6) Smoking<br>\n(7) Irradiation. <br>\n </p>",
