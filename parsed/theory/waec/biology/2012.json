        "answer": "<p>(a) <strong>Factors affecting the rate of diffusion: - </strong>Presence of concentration gradient; when concentration of substance is high the rate of movement of molecules will increase/molecules move from the region of higher concentration to the region of lower concentration; leading to an increase in the rate of diffusion. Surface area: Large surface area will allow more molecules of substance to diffuse. State/nature of the diffusing substance: Molecules in gaseous state diffuse faster than those in liquids or solid states/molecules in solid state diffuse slower than those of liquid and gas. Size of the molecules/particles: The smaller molecules will move/diffuse faster than larger molecules. Temperature: Increase in temperature increases the movement of molecules/increases in diffusion/decrease in temperature slows down movement of molecules/decreases diffusion.</p><p>(b)(i) <strong>Active transport:</strong> This is the movement of molecules from a region of low concentration to a region of high concentration/against a concentration gradient. Across a living membrane. Using energy from the cell.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Transpiration</strong>: Loss of water in the form of vapour; from the aerial parts of plants.</p><p>(c)<strong> Reduction of Transpiration: </strong>Closure of stomata during the day. Reduction of leaf size/leaf modified into spines. Dropping of leaves in the dry season. Development of thick cuticle. Presence of hairs over leave surfaces. Presence of sunken stomata.</p><p>(d) <strong>Red Blood Cells: </strong>Biconcave shape/disc-like, increases its surface area for oxygen uptake. Elastic membrane, enables it to flow easily through the blood vessels. Presence of hemoglobin; for oxygen uptake. Thin membrane; for easy diffusion of oxygen/carbon-dioxide. <br>\n </p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) <strong>Role of the stomach in digestion:</strong> The stomach receives food when the sphincter at the entrance of the stomach relaxes. The muscular walls of the stomach contract and relax, to churn/mix the food, and further break down the particles. The stomach produces gastric juices, which contain dilute hydrochloric acid/pepsin/rennin. The dilute hydrochloric acid neutralizes the action of the salivary amylase, and kills bacteria present in the food. It creates a suitable condition/pH for the action of pepsin, and activates inactive pepsinogen to form pepsin. The pepsin breaks down the protein to polypeptide/peptides. While the rennin coagulates/curdles milk to enhance digestion by pepsin. The mucus produced by the stomach wall lines the wall of the stomach to prevent the action of the acid on the stomach wall. The mucus produced by the stomach lubricates the movement of the food in the alimentary canal.</p><p>(b)(i) <strong>Parts of plants where food is stored:</strong> Leaves. Stems. Roots. Seed. Fruits.<br>\n(ii) <strong>Examples:</strong><br>\n<strong>Leaves</strong>: Onions, shallot, garlic.<br>\n<strong>Stems</strong>: Yam, sugarcane, ginger, Irish potatoes.<br>\n<strong>Roots</strong>: Cassava, carrots, sweet potatoes.<br>\n<strong>Seed</strong>: Groundnut, beans, coconut, cashew.<br>\n<strong>Fruits</strong>: Maize, guava, orange, pawpaw, cashew, palm nut, mango.</p><p>(c)<strong> Sugar regulation in mammals:</strong> The liver controls the blood glucose levels. It converts excess glucose in the blood to glycogen. The process is stimulated by the hormone insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas. When the blood glucose level falls below normal. The pancreas secretes/glucagons. This stimulates the conversion of glycogen into glucose, which is released into the blood. <br>\n </p>",
