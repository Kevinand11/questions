        "answer": "<p>4. (a) Fish bears a protective colouration. The darker upper part camouflages it against fishermen, while the silvery lower part protects it against predators (bigger sea animals), since looking from below the water blends it with the sky. The different colours in fish are referred to as countershading. Other forms of adaptive colouration are (i) green colours of grasshopper which camouflages it from predators like lizards, birds and mammals (ii) the colour. of lizards (ranging from brown to grey) make it to blend with the soil walls and tree-backs (for wild species) and as such are protected from predators such as snakes (iii) Chameleon possesses photosensitive cells on its skin and is able to change or blend with the colour of any environment in which it finds itself (iv) Bright colours to ward off enemies e.g ladybirds</p>",

It increases inorganic content of the soil and kills the soil micro-organisms (ii) Fertilizer application changes the soil pH, alters chemical composition of the soil and adds nutrients to the so Other ways include: (iii) Tillage leads to erosion, aeration and leaching of soil (iv) Irrigation brings about high humidity and increased moisture content of the soil. It decreases air content and aeration of the environment.  (v) Herbicides and pesticides pollute water and land. They also alter the vegetation or fauna (vi) Bush clearing destroys vegetation</p>",
