        "answer": "<p>(a) <ins><strong>Mode of formation of chemically formed sedimentary rocks: -</strong></ins> major agent is water - water with existing rocks - solutions are formed -formed from the accumulation of materials derived from other rocks- mineral salts are precipitated e.g. iron stone/limonite from hydrated iron oxide - direct evaporation of water leaves solid precipitates e.g. rock salt - accumulation over a long period of time - cementation of precipitated rocks - hardening of cemented rocks - accumulation of sediments could be in layers/strata -variation in thickness of strata - variation in thickness of strata</p><p>(b) <ins><strong>Examples of chemically formed of sedimentary rocks:</strong></ins> rock salt (sodium chloride or common salt) - nitrates-alabasta -a form of limestone -gypsum/calcium sulphate - anhydrites- dolorite (calcium carbon- ate) - potash - borax- limorite (iron stone) - limonite - flint (silicate).</p><p>(c) <ins><strong>Importance of chemically formed sedimentary rocks: </strong></ins>source of minerals - construction purposes - tourist attraction provides employment soil formation- foreign exchange earning raw materials for industries - used in reducing acidity of soils - food - used in health care e.g. pop and caoline - development of mining towns.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) <strong>Meaning of a lake: </strong>A body of water, accumulated in a depression or basin and surrounded by land<br>\n(b)<strong> Formation of lakes by wind erosion:-</strong> Occurs mainly in the arid regions - rocks deeply weathered - loose non-consolidated soil runs deep below surface no wind breaks - wind speed is high - winds have strong erosive power - wind deflation sets in - continuous action of wind deflation creates a hollow - eddy action of the wind further widens and deepens the depression/hollow - water table is reached-deflation ceases when the water table is reached water seeps out to form a lake - lake is usually small and shallow-excessive evaporation makes the water salty - e.g. Quattara Depression in Egypt, Great Basin of Utah, USA<br>\n(C) <strong>Benefits of lakes to man: -</strong> means of transportation- source of fish - source of common salt-source of water for reared animals - regulates flow of rivers - attracts settlements in arid and semi - arid regions - reserves water for HEP generation - source of domestic water supply - tourist attraction sports and recreation - health resort - moderation of climate - for employment - for irrigation water for industrial purposes - centres for aquatic research.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a) (i) <strong>Characteristics of Time Zone: -</strong> refers to a region where the same standard time is used - spans 15º of longitude-there are 24 time zones in all - each has its own standard time - time difference between 2 adjacent time zones is 1 hour - local time is determined by the central meridian within the zone longitude O° is the reference point for all time zones - time zones east of GMT are ahead in tme - time zones west of GMT are behind in time -west and east time zones are separated by the IDL - demarcating lines are not so straight areas with large longitudinal stretch have more than one time zone.<br>\n(ii) <strong>Characteristics of International Date Line: -</strong> it is at the 180° meridian - an imaginary line - located half way round the world from the Prime Meridian passes through the Mid-Pacific Ocean - it avoids cutting through oceanic islands and countries - the longitude which marks the difference in the day/time - a day is gained when it is crossed to the east - a day is lost when it is crossed to the west- it joins the Prime Meridian to form a Great Circle.<br>\n(b) <strong>Calculation of longitude of Town B: - </strong>longitude of Town A = 30º W - time in Town A =9.00am = 9 hours time in Town B = 6.00pn = 18 hours - longitude of Town B = ? - 15° of longitude is = 1 hour - Difference in time between towns B and A is 18 hours - 9 hours - Difference in Longitude = 9 hours x 15º - = 135 - Time of town B is 6.00pm which is ahead of Town A - Therefore, Town B is to the east of Town A-Longitude of town B 135°-30° = 105°E.</p>",

        "answer": "<p><strong>(a)Mode of formation of stacks </strong>- formed near a coast-formed by wave erosion - presence of headland wave erosion attacks headland at both sides - cracks or lines of weakness develop on both sides of the 6 headland - cracks widen - hydraulic action wave abrasion - caves are formed from the cracks on both side of headland - further erosion causes adjacent caves to join - an arch is formed - roof of arch collapses - stack is formed - further erosion reduces stack to a stump examples include the Old Man of Hoy and the Needles of England, Axim Stack in Ghana, Nkontompo stack in Ghana.</p><p><strong>(b) Mode of formation of fold mountain: - </strong>formed from large scale earth movement - horizontal movement or crustal blocks - formed by compression forces within the earths crust - the forces cause stress within the crust - presence of large depression called geosynclines - depression or geosynclines caused by down wraping of the crust - materials eroded from continental blocks are deposited in the depressions - sedimentary rocks are formed weight of sediments causes further subsidence of the geosynclines-of the sediments causes adjacent continental blocks/tectonic plates to move towards each other - compression of the sediments leads to the warping (up folding and down folding) of deposits upfolds are called anticlines -downfolds are called synclines - upfolds become crests of fold mountains - further narrow e aepression causes more intense folding ttat form fold mountain examples include Rocky, Andes, Mt. Alps, Atlas Mt., etc.</p>",
