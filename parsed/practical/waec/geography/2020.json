        "answer": "<p>(a) <strong>Definition of weathering:</strong> Weathering is the disintegration or decomposition of rocks in situ by physical, chemical or biological processes. (b) <strong>Factors that affect weathering:</strong> temperature Changes/climate, rainfall/moisture climate, types/nature of rocks; living organisms (plants and animals), - relief/topography; time.<br>\n(c) <strong>Description or the processes of exfoliation: </strong>physIcal mechanical weathering, occurs in desert/arid regions, - plutonic rocks are exposed to the surtace by erosIon, - the removal of the heavy overlying rock materials relax the pressure on the rock; the rocks expand slightly in volume around the exposed surtaces, the expansion makes the exposed side weak and more vulnerable to external forces, expansion causes cracks parallel to the surface, - thin layers on the exposed surface peel off and are called sheeting structures - high temperatures at day causes outer layers of exposed rocks to expand, - drop in temperatures at night causes outer layers of rocks to contract faster than the inner layers.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>(a)<strong> Differences between weather and climate:</strong> weather shows the immediate state of the atmosphere while climate gives the average Condition of the atmosphere, - weather is the condition of the atmosphere as experienced for a short period of time while climate is the condition of the atmosphere as experienced over a long period of time usually for over 35 years, - weather description covers a relatively small area while climate description covers wide areas, - weather descriptions cannot be generalized while climatic descriptions can be generalised, - weather is dominated by one element at a time while climate is dominated by several elements at a time, - weather changes frequently while climate changes after a long period of time, - all weather elements are considered and measured in the description of climate while only selected elements are considered in weather description. (b)<strong> Instruments used in measuring weather elements:</strong> (i) Sunshine-Sundial/Sunshine Recorder/Campbel strokes recorder/pyranometer (ii) Rainfall- Cloud Cover ceilometers/Oktas/cloud mirror<br>\n(c) <strong>Explanation of how wind is measured: </strong>Measure With anemometer,-anemometer placed open space - anemometer has four metal cups, the cups are fitted to metal arms, - a shaft is connecting the metal arm to a meter  - cups rotate freely on the vertical shaft- the stronger the wind,  the faster the rotation- the number of rotations is indicated on the meter to give the speed of the wind - measured in knot/hour- measured in knot by marine professionals- measured in aeronautical applications; the observation is made twice a day, the measurement is not so reliable because the cups/shaft continue to rotate after the wind stops. <strong>Recording of wind speed: </strong>recording takes place daily, - usually between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., - recording is done in a noted book, day of recording is stated; recording is signed by the observer.</p>",
