        "question": "<p>(a) State the title of the experimental set-up for specimens A, B, and C.</p><p>(b) If 50cm\\(^{3}\\) of water is added to each of specimens A, B, and C, calculate the amount of water retained by each specimen</p><p>(c) From the results of your calculation in (b) above, identify specimens A, B, and C with reasons</p><p>(d) State the conclusion of the experimental set-up</p><p>(e) State four functions of water to crop plants</p>",
        "answer": "<p>(a) Title of the experimental set-up: Experiment to compare the porosity, drainage, retention, permeability, or water-holding capacity of soil types.</p><p>(b) Amount of water retained by each soil type:</p><p>Amount of water poured in each sample = 50cm\\(^{3}\\);<br>\nAmount of water that drained into the measuring cylinder Å = X\\(_{1}\\), cm\\(^{3}\\);<br>\nAmount of water that drained into the measuring cylinder B = X\\(_{2}\\), cm\\(^{3}\\)<br>\nAmount of water that drained into the measuring cylinder C = X\\(_{3}\\), cm\\(^{3}\\)<br>\nTherefore, the amount of water retained bý Specimen ;</p><p>A is 50 - X\\(_{1}\\) = Y \\(_{1}\\) cm\\(^{3}\\) <br>\nB is 50 - X\\(_{2}\\) = Y \\(_{2}\\) cm\\(^{3}\\) <br>\nC is 50 - X\\(_{3}\\) = Y \\(_{3}\\) cm\\(^{3}\\) </p><p>(c) Based on observations and results from the experimental set-up, identification of Specimen A = sand, B= clay, C= loam.</p><p>Reasons:</p><ul>\n<li>A has large pore spaces hence retained the least amount of water.</li>\n<li>B has tiny pore spaces, it retained the largest amount of water.</li>\n<li>C has average pore spaces thus, retaining the average amount of water</li>\n</ul><p>(d) Conclusion of the experimental set-up: -</p><ul>\n<li>Sandy soil (Specimen A) with larger particles, little organic matter, and larger pore spaces was most porous.</li>\n<li>Clay soil (Specimen B)with very fine particles and small pore spaces is the least porous.</li>\n<li>Loamy soil (Specimen C) with moderate air spaces, more organic matter, and slightly bigger particles than clay was second most porous.</li>\n</ul><p>(e) Functions of water to crop plants:</p><ul>\n<li>It can be used for the utilization of soil minerals by crop plants.</li>\n<li>It is also an essential raw material in photosynthesis.</li>\n<li>It is used for hydrolyzing food nutrients e.g. starch, protein, fat., acceleration of enzymatic activities,</li>\n<li>For proper growth of plants,</li>\n<li>for turgidity of plant cells, translocation of foods, temperature regulation, and also to aid transpiration.</li>\n</ul>",
