No judge can be removed from the office except by a very difficult process of impeachment.</li>\n<li><strong>High Salary:</strong> Every Judge of the Supreme Court gets a high salary. Besides this, each judge is entitled to free residential accommodation, medical allowance and several other perks.

The Supreme Court can punish any institution or person who is found guilty of contempt of court.</li>\n<li><strong>Vast Jurisdiction and the Power of Judicial Review: </strong>Judiciary in Nigeria enjoys a vast jurisdiction. It acts as the guardian interpreter of the Constitution, the protector of Fundamental Rights of the people and the arbiter of disputes between the Union and the States.

After a long history of political, economic, and social injustices, many groups begin to start coups to stop the trend of injustice.</p><p>2) Greed: coups are started by groups of people who are tired of resource and other kinds of economic exploitation. Many leaders in Africa exploit their own land and people to extract valuable natural resource reserves, which eventually takes a toll on citizens. These citizens eventually start coups in hopes of attaining benefits of resources. (ex. Chad - many of Chad's coups have been started because of greed - stemming from exploitation of oil reserves in Chad)</p><p>3) Colonial Effect: many scholars argue that the cause of coups in Africa stems from colonialism. Colonialism implemented an ideology across Africa that justified the attainment of power through force.
