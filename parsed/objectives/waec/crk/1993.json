        "explanation": "<p>The Second Coming is when Jesus Christ will return to earth in fulfillment of His promises and to fulfill the prophecies made about Him. Jesus Himself promised, \"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory\" (<a href=\"https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Matthew%2024%3A30&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.AllAboutGOD.com/bible.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 24:30</a>). <a href=\"https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Revelation%2019%3A11-12&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.AllAboutGOD.com/bible.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Revelation 19:11-12</a> proclaims this about the Second Coming, \"I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and makes war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.\"</p><p>The second coming should also not be confused with the event referred to as the Rapture. The Rapture refers to a time when Jesus Christ will come to remove all believers from the earth (<a href=\"https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=1%20Thessalonians%204%3A13-18&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.AllAboutGOD.com/bible.htm\" target=\"_blank\">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>; <a href=\"https://ebible.com/query?utf=8%E2%9C%93&amp;query=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A50-54&amp;translation=ESV&amp;redirect_iframe=https://www.AllAboutGOD.com/bible.htm\" target=\"_blank\">1 Corinthians 15:50-54</a>). The church holds many positions on the rapture, but the Second Coming is undisputed.
