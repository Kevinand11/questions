        "explanation": "<p>A hindrance to the democratization of the United Nations is Resistance of the big powers.<br>\n<br>\nIt is the five permanent members of the Security Council that is usually referred to as the big powers. The big five are as follows:<br>\n<br>\n1. U.S.A<br>\n2. Britain<br>\n3. Russia<br>\n4. China and<br>\n5. France.<br>\n<br>\nEach of the five permanent members of this Security Council has a veto power. In most cases this could be used to satisfy their respective selfish interest at the expense of fulfilling the objectives of the Organization. The United Nations has in most cases proved helpless in cases of aggression involving big powers . For example America invaded Vietnam and Iraq. The defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) also once invaded Afghanistan but nothing was done by the United Nations Organization in each case. Again the United Nation's Power of sanction is often ignored by member states especially the big powers. For instance, when economic sanction was placed on a country such as in South Africa during the period of apartheid policy, some member states such as Britain still traded with the country.<br>\n<br>\nSo it should be clearly realized that the veto power and permanent status of some member states in the Security Council is highly discriminatory and undemocratic.</p>",
