        "explanation": "<p><strong> 1samuel 15:1-33</strong></p><p><strong>  Because</strong> you have <strong>rejected</strong> the word of the LORD, <strong>He</strong> also has <strong>rejected</strong> you from being <strong>king</strong>: In his empty religious practice, rebellion, and stubbornness against God, <strong>Saul rejected God’s</strong> word. So, God rightly <strong>rejected</strong> him <strong>as king over Israel. </strong>Saul was rejected as king not specifically because he offered sacrifices, but because he disobeyed a direct command that God had given him through the prophet Samuel. Samuel had told Saul, “Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. </p><p>I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+10%3A1-8&amp;version=NIV\">wait seven days</a> until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”  But Saul, worried that his whole army would desert him, offered the sacrifices himself, just before Samuel arrived.</p><p>“You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel told him. “<em>You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you</em>; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, <em>because you have not kept the Lord’s command</em>.”  In other words, the penalty for this outright disobedience to a direct command from God was that Saul would not be the founder of a royal dynasty; while he would remain king, his descendants would not rule after him.</p><p><em><strong>Secondarily</strong></em>, however, this disobedience did lead Saul to usurp a privilege of the priesthood. By offering these sacrifices, Saul was imitating the Canaanite priest-king model instead of respecting the separation between the kingship and the priesthood that was established in the law of Moses.</p><p>Saul subsequently disobeyed another direct command from God when he was told, again through the prophet Samuel, to completely <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2015&amp;version=NIV\">destroy the Amalekites</a>.*  Saul instead kept their king, Agag, alive as a trophy of war, and his soldiers kept the best of the cattle to “sacrifice to the Lord”—as part of a grand feast that they would enjoy themselves.  Samuel asked Saul once again, “<em>Why did you not obey the Lord?</em>”  The penalty for outright disobedience this time was that Saul would not even remain king himself for his natural lifetime; he would die early and be succeeded by “one of his neighbors”—not one of his own descendants.</p>",
