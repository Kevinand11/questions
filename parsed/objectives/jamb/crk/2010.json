        "question": "<p>Isaiah emphasized holiness above all things because God</p>",
        "explanation": "<p>If someone called you \"holy\" would you consider it to be a compliment? It would probably depend on two things. First, it would depend on whether another word was attached to the word holy, such as, \"a holy roller\" or \"holier than thou\" or a \"Holy Joe\". In these cases the term would be considered derisive . . .a negative connotation. And secondly it would depend on the person's definition of holiness. In the mind of many, \"holy\" means; narrow-minded, uptight, judgmental, detached, Victorian and other negative words. In this case being called holy would not be a compliment. But if you were called holy in the Biblical sense, it would be a great compliment . . . one we might be very uncomfortable with.</p><p>Of all the attributes of God . . . holiness is the one that seems to take center stage. Most of you know that in the Hebrew language to repeat a word is to emphasize it. For example if you said a stone was big it would mean one thing. If you said the stone was big big . . . you would mean it was a really big stone. If it was big, big, big, it would mean that it was a gigantic boulder.</p><p>In Isaiah 6 and in Revelation 4 the angels declare that God is \"holy, holy, holy\". This is the only attribute of God that is emphasized in this way. God is never called \"Love, love, love,\" or \"mercy, mercy, mercy\". Therefore, if we want to know God we must understand the idea of God's holiness.</p><p>isaiah 6:1-8.</p>",

Because He was a Jew, it was important that His body be removed and placed in the tomb before sundown. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea gained permission to do so from Pilate. They placed His body into Joseph's new tomb. The stone was rolled into place to close the entrance of the tomb, and later a Roman seal was placed upon it and Roman soldiers were charged with guarding the entrance to the tomb.</p><p>He saved others, but He cannot save Himself. He performed mighty miracles for others, but now He lies there helpless in death. His disciples go about the streets, weeping and saying, \"It is all over now. He is dead.\"</p><p>But death cannot hold Him! A tomb of stone cannot imprison the mighty Christ. Friday night goes by, Saturday goes by, and Sunday morning comes. In the early dawn some women who loved Him came to the tomb. To their great astonishment the stone had been rolled away.</p><p>They rush into the tomb filled with fear that someone had defiled the grave of their Savior and stolen away His body. They found two angels with a very important message! It was the message of the empty tomb. \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee?\"</p><p>This is the greatest message ever given to the world. Jesus is living! Death could not hold Him! The tomb is empty and Jesus is alive! Over the next forty days He appeared in His resurrected body many times to His friends. Then He ascended into heaven and He is there today! <em><strong>mark16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.\"</strong></em></p><p> </p>",
