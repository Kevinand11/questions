They do this by increasing interest rates to encourage people to save or invest and discourage borrowings. By saving and investment, the excess money in the economy is taken out. For instance, if interest rates are set at 20%, people would prefer to save or invest their monies so as to get a high return on investment rather than borrowing from the banks and pay high interest rates.  </p>",
